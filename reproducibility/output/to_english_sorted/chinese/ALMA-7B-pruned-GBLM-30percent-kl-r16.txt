The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "the elderly and the young" will continue to be the focus of continuous attention in the field of financial education; the reports released by Nielsen and CCTV Finance show that the young generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important channel for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation. Although the young generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, it is quite different from the "overindulgent" label attached by the outside world, but some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-the-trend consumption behavior, which has led to a large financial burden and debt risk, and even caused social problems to increase. Financial institutions should be willing to shoulder their social responsibilities and provide positive guidance.
