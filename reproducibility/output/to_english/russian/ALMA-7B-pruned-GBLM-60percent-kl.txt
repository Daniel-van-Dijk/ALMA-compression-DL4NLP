From my point of view, the program for literature was formed by women of balzagovsky age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century we preferred Danilovsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote belletrystics, of course, from the perspective of those dam ballzagous age.
The psychology and torments of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenova for teenagers are not so interesting.

Thank you very much. It is very interesting.

I remember these feasts and guests in the house of my parents.
Guests on the porch, and on the plates yet cooked dishes are being grilled, and Mama is cleaning the floor.
God, I'm sitting at the table already without strength.
And then, I washed the dishes, I cleaned the house.
For a week before the holiday, you take products, two days stripping, a day cleaning after.
Guests, what?
It's good for him, and a treat is obligatory with him.
Since then I don't like parties, guests.

Germany: Fourth vaccination from coronavirus is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be conclusive, and will continue with new strength.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, two or three doses of the vaccine against the coronavirus, likely, will not be enough for full protection.
This is confirmed by the head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Vajgeldt.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, the latest in September," the expert said.
In addition, Vajheldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with the vaccination against the gripap".
This will help achieve the best results.
Besides, enhanced vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of coronavirus "Omicron".
The new variant is especially dangerous.
So, the likelihood of reinfection with "Omicron" is three times higher than the strains Delta or Beta.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary investigation carried out in South Africa.
From this, BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine, adapted for Omicron, by March 2022.
Companies highlight that two doses of vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of coronavirus "Omicron".
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that the efficacy of the two doses of the vaccine is significantly lower: "neutralizing potential decreases more than 25 times".
This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the Omicron strain, BioNTech and Pfizer said.
Therefore a third dose is needed.
Experts urge the acceleration of vaccination in the country.
For example, Chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases Bernd Zalzberger advocates for shortening the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, as Zalczberger believes, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of delta and omicron variants of the coronavirus.
Israel's experience has been very convincing," the expert said.
Vobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a particular branch of the Bet-A family from the company Pontoon21Â®.
She (like the Kalikana Vib) is different from many other varieties in that it was originally designed for underwater fishing, not just for fishing in the surface.
These baits have a larger, than the close comparables, specific weight, that, undoubtedly, positively affects on the aspects of use of these interesting baits.
Another recognizable characteristic is the upper flanking from a strong and tough plastic, creating additional vibrations in the vertical and horizontal tracks.
As a winter bite, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a fairly aggressive game.
Often the most obvious animation is simple monotonic animation, that is, movements up and down almost without pauses.
Planning a deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient for fishing in confined space, overgrown with underwater vegetation, coregas, and other obstacles, for which it is possible to catch.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant at catching winter pike and large cod, and especially in the middle of winter, when a demanding and aggressive presentation is required.
After reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly rotates and returns to the initial vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter fishing for trout.
To satisfy her whims, you can choose from two versions: with noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
Also noted that Bet-A-Vib game is capable of disrupting passive fish, not reacting even to the fish.
Bite-A-Vib demonstrates distance and accuracy.
This bubble is understandable and not capricious, it matches well with lashes and braided lines even of large diameters.
For catching the pike, suckers, herring or ockrean besides even-handed, sometimes with "chirkan" on the bottom.
If you are fishing in areas that are heavily lined, you can change the front tackle to a double hook, which will reduce the chances of getting snagged.
Among its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most reliable.
With equal success, it can be used on relatively small, as well as on relatively deep areas.
All models are equipped with hooks Owner ST-36.

Libya claims 7,000 Russian contractors
In Libya there are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) Wagner.
This was announced by the Chairman of the Highest State Council of the Republic of Haled Al-Mishri on Sunday, December 12.
At present in Libya there are more than 7,000 mercenaries hired by Wagner.
They have planes.
They also dig trenches in Serte and Kufre.
They have 30 reactive aircraft at Garabia air bases (used also as civilian airport in Sirte), according to Anadolu news agency.
Haleed al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries "are trying to take over" central Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they "bring their man to power" in Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the interviewer of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled" in Libya.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an air base and port in Sirte, as well as an air base in Juufre, according to the report.
Russian authorities officially deny that Wagner uses Kremlin's support.
Where else can be hired
According to the agency, "Wagner" operates in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Angola and Zimbabwe.
The company ensures military training of local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, daughter companies "Vagnera" receive certain privileges and licenses to use useful mineral resources and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technologies and military services in these countries," the article says.
According to media reports, "Wagner" allegedly fought in Donbas, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and CAR.
This group is not listed in the power department, nor in the registry of jurists, and its members are absent from the personnel list.
This company is under sanctions from the United States.
Recently, 27 countries in the European Union approved restrictions against "Vagener".
It is expected that this decision of the European Council will be approved on December 13.
Situation in Libya
The highest state council of Libya de facto is the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for moving the one-day voting period to February 2022 at least by February 2022.
With less than two weeks left before the election, the odds are dropping that they will make it on time," the article notes.
On this basis, the Higher Electoral Commission of Libya postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates, reports Sky News Arabia.
Outside politics through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in foreign policy of the country, 29% consider that failures prevail.
Examples of success - "in Syria defended, restored peace there", "decision on "Severny Pipeline-2", "whole world scared, that crude weapons".
The main failures - "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with western countries", "isolation from the world", - says in the study of the Foundation "Public Opinion".
The Dubai government has completely rejected paper production - all government services have become digital
The Dubai government announced a full withdrawal from paper-based production and switching to digital technologies.
All state services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
Today's day marked the beginning of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said the Emirati prince, chairman of the Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Maktoum.
Now internal and external document turnover in all Dubai government institutions will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all without exception: healthcare, housing and utilities, police, municipal authorities, courts and the like. The government joined many commercial structures.
The transition to electronic governance and digitization of document processing began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to authorities, savings have amounted to 336 million paper sheets, which equals 14 million hours of human labour and 353.8 million dollars in dollar equivalent.
Moscow's former mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens two days a year.
Dana, now, about the date of birth and how many years the child is, this is already madness, about the class and group in the kindergarten, too.
I don't believe that such stretching is possible.
And if they do happen, then they are obviously on all of the family, including the family.
My mother lived with her two brothers and grandfather and grandmother on the 3rd floor of a building without shutters.
They started by knocking on the door, then on the window, then they decided not to be bothered, they broke the window and entered, but the dad had a broken window, which they received.
These people knew that there was someone at home.
Production and exports of Turkish cars fell below the level of 2020
Production and exports of Turkish cars decreased in November due to depreciation of lira.
According to Bloomberg, the industry's results for the 11-month period were worse than last year's results, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November, Turkey produced 115,000 vehicles, which is 20% less than the previous year.
More than 75,900 units were exported, which is more than 25% less than the previous year.
And if the first 10 months of this year the automotive sector of Turkey demonstrated a positive dynamics compared to the previous year, the production of automobiles decreased by 0.3% compared to the previous year.
The reason for this fall was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which fell in November by 29% compared to the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 subbects MSB received postponement of credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alyhan Smailyov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of incentives for small and medium businesses, reports correspondent MIA "Kazinform".
According to the information of the Kazakhstan Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year, the order of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated April 1, 2021, No. 127 "On the approval of the order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021, No. 127 "On the approval of the order of the provision of postponement of payments for loans of the sub-sectors of small and medium businesses," wrote Alihan Smailyov in his response to the parliamentary request.
He reminded that the order of postponement of payments for loans was provided by banks and organizations, engaged in microfinancing activities, from April 1 to April 30, 2021, to the subjects of MSB, including IP, in the period from April 1 to April 30, 2021.
The deferment period ranged from 30 to 90 days.
In the borrower's statement, the lender may specify another repayment period.
During the deferment period regarding the borrower, the lender suspended the pre-litigation work, notified the borrower about the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as taking the lender's commissions and other fees," said the deputy minister.
In 2021, 603 borrowers from the second level submitted applications for postponement of payments on loans, of which 553 borrowers from the second level received postponement of payments on loans on a sum of 9.7 billion tenge.
The MFO filed applications for deferment of 131 sub-unit of the MSB, of which deferment was provided to 95 sub-units at a sum of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailyov.
A pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with a weak immune system are able to easily carry the strain "omicron".
A doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may carry it easier than those with strong immune response.
Virologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the coronavirus "omicron" may be dangerous.
The reason lies in the conditions of the virus.
Scientists believe that "HIV" originated in the tele of an infected with HIV or a person suffering from immunodeficiency.
So, there was no resistance from the immune system.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Because there was no response from the immune system, he became very fast.
Apparently, there are these spike-antibodies, spigots, may be more than allowed, their antibodies are not mutated during mutations, - comments the immunologist Sergey Puryasev.
A doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may carry the "omicron" easier than those with strong immune response.
It turns out that the body's response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's how it happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s die, and the elderly in their 60s carry it.
The immune response of the young is completely inappropriate: there, where you can only poke your fingers, he beats, as if from a cannon, - said Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that there are dangerous side effects and the most dangerous of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first treatment is very successful and fast, in the second case, you can cure only symptoms - all hope on the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia is beginning of intoxication of organism - it is temperature, weakness, fatigue.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, cough, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also signal developing problems.
By the end of the year, Russia may begin to vaccinate the growing population from 12 to 18 years.
The virologist, head of the genetic laboratory of the MFPTI Paul Volchkov noted that this category is very actively affected by the coronavirus.
For teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts is maximized.
This is the most socially active layer, like preschoolers, said Moskov 24's Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the genetic laboratory of the MFTHI.
Huge thanks to the author for this article.

Immunologists propose hypothesis that people with obesity become victims of COVID
The authors examined the adipose tissue, left over from barrier surgeries, and found that adipose cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells, located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also infected, showing a strong inflammatory response.
Researchers also examined the fat tissue of patients who died of COVID, and found particles of coronavirus in fat, surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and grippas can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in attempts to evade the immune system.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this.
Biologist explained the reasons for the appearance of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semen Goloshikin named the reasons of dementia and told about ways of its prevention in an interview with Sputnik.
According to WHO, this disease affects more than 55 million people.
The syndrome manifests itself by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - with time, the person finds it difficult to orientate in familiar surroundings.
Goloschin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infectious diseases, metabolic disorders and deficiency of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertonia, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
On a behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and a lack of active cognitive activity," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by bad habits - smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, sleep disorder and inactive lifestyle.
Among the first signs of experts, he noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and decrease of abstract thinking.
There is a discussion that hearing loss may be an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease, and one of the risk factors for its onset," the biologist added.
For prevention of disease WHO recommends to maintain adequate level of physical activity, train cognitive skills and abilities, requiring involvement of memory and logic.

N.I. Pirogova, head of the department of cognitive disorders at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies Anna Bogolepova spoke about the reasons for problems with memory.
Egypt returned around 30,000 illegally exported artifacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the government of Kaira has been able to return to the country approximately 30,000 artifacts that were illegally exported from the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, in the airwaves of the television channel Al-Hayat by the head inspector of the department of ancient sites in the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gaoud.
Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
Only this year at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., 5,300 ancient Egyptian civilizations were uncovered, he said.
Abdel Gaouaid clarified that all smuggled artifacts were registered in archives.
The staff of the department are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "track auctions worldwide and sales online" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The main inspector said that the cultural heritage will be restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to his words, one of the returned artifacts was discovered in Belgium, an ancient skeleton of a man who is now part of the Egyptian civilization exhibition in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities turned to Interpol with a request to help find the auctioned bust of Tutahamon.
Christie's auction house held auctions on July 4, during which a bust with an age of more than 3,000 years was sold for $5.97 million (around 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also asserts that the object of art was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luksore in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanahamona, depicted in the image of the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and was not displayed at auction since 1985.
How the relic found its way to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively pursuing repatriation of artifacts illegally removed from the country over the past years.
According to authorities, 95% of contraband antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers."
The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account - and this is correct, because the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent nation (similar to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people - so many Tatars (Kazanis) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words.
Unites them only the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants to get access to personal mobile devices of staff
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes Financial Times.
The issue is that in Europe and the United States Swiss bank does not provide corporate communications to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - telecommunication operator.
Under existing rules, the bank can scrutinize information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used for resolving business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank uses the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if a staff member used it for a meeting with a client, which was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees transitioned to remote work, the bank wants to extend this policy to all devices that were used to resolve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management established a deadline, up to which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse information about a new requirement is not commented upon.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the earthly life of the poet and his "ego".
He is not a member of any literary associations, he has been spoiled with imaginism, he is himself, but known, and demanded, even sometimes cruelly criticized, even spitefully, but the reading public is willing to carry him in their hands.
More than 60 poems were written over the year, many of them - true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, a poem "Anna Snegina" was published, eight books were published, a collection "Russian Soviet".
The main success was in the end of June 25th year, the State Publishing Agency concluded a contract with Esenin to publish his works in three volumes.
Nobody of modern Sergey Alexandrovich poets has achieved such honor, he is the first!
That was a very good money - according to the contract, the remuneration amounted to 1000 rubles every month for 20 months (the director of the factory, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
The funds in that year were needed as never before.
Esenin married the daughter of Lev Tolstoy Sofya Tolstoy, it was necessary to organize family life, take care of sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as mother.
Apparently life was improving, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything was colored in the dark tones, as if he had materialized a black man from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published already after the death of Esinina):
My friend, my friend.
I am very and very ill.
I don't know where this came from.
The wind whistles
On a deserted and lonely field.
That's how I got in September.
The brain is intoxicated with alcohol.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin was very sick, looked very ill, was clearly ill.
All the time, repetitions, nervous outbursts.
And the reason, probably, is not only in alcoholism...
However, if such diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergey Alexandrovich was diagnosed by someone, authentic documents do not exist.
Let's say, relating to May 1923, when Yessin insisted on fourth wife, American Ayesdoras Duncan to treat his health in a clinic in Paris by Professor Petr Ganunshkin (again to him Yessin came two years later, already in Moscow).
But there are testimonies of the poet, scandals on this ground, prejudices in the police abundantly - scattered all over dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20th century, the poet's romance with the green snake developed rapidly.
At the end of the year 1923, Esenin for a short time stayed with a friend, Ivan Starcev.
Surprisingly, but at Yessinin's with his very good income, he never had his own apartment either in Moscow or in Piter, he lived on rent apartments, in hotels or with friends.
Starcev remembers:
He came only to sleep, and in most cases in a drunken state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Esinin fell on the staircase.
He paddled himself in the face and chirped.
After a bit of rest, he began coughing, spraying the entire floor with blood."
And even Esinin himself after the visit to Europe and in the United States (in the United States at that time there was a dry law, but Duncan took with himself a considerable amount of alcohol) acknowledged:
I saw nothing there, except taverns and streets...
I am already at the end and people stopped remembering...
Well, of course...
I was pissed because I was grumpy.

Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus uses migrants as "weapons" against the EU
Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus uses migrants as "weapons".
Poland's deputy foreign minister Pawel Jablowski expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as "weapons" against the European Union and intends to return to such "operation" in the next year.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made an announcement in an interview with the newspaper Australian Financial Review.
According to Yabloenko, sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko," but he "is actively looking for new ways.
Also, the Polish official is confident that now illegal migrants will use weapons "in many points of the world".
The website kp.ru reported earlier that the European Union activated the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 physical people and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they announced readiness and further expansion of restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk responded with a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by Sennyka shapka": when a barhatty pajak makes out of a man's posmeisht
At social events in 2021, dominated barhat dresses.
The first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
In September at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die" he appeared in a black satin jacket and a traditional bonnet.
After his example twice followed by Prince William, who initially wore a green barhat jacket, but then chose a more classic option for the event in support of a charitable fund, the Royal Variety.
A few days ago, Trend tried on himself and Lionel Messesie.
The footballer came to take the seventh "Golden Ball" in a Dolce & Gabbana suit.
His sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already noting the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the analytics of the service "Gazeta.Ru", they became to buy in 1.4 times more.
The most popular are warm fur coats with padding and a tailored silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, brown, navy and, of course, black.
The average price of such models - from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. Men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - sets of leather suits they choose more often.
You can buy them not only at online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the segment luxe jackets in this season are represented practically in all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most beloved model is Gucci, who starred in one of the premiere films "House Gucci" ambassador of the brand, Jared Leto.
Choosing expensive jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a unique weaving technique, the fabric has a dense weave with a textured outer surface and a smooth inner surface.
Cheaper alternatives are made of cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, they last less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilia Vakhonkin warns that the main thing in the case of a leather jacket is not its model or style, but its appropriateness.
Barhat requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal, if you are going to a party or a formal event, says Vakhoshkin. - It will fit for those cases, if the dress code is mentioned as "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion, compliance with which allows to make a choice in favor of a barber jacket, is the status of its buyer.
A man in a leather jacket, first of all, should get a proper suit with pockets, according to the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Crasavich Brammeill", - say the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Crasavich Brammeill". - Owners of leather jackets, as a rule, belong to the cast of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to attend social events where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhushkin proposes to combine a jacket made of velvet with similar attire: classic trousers with buttons, one-toned shirts, silk socks, belts with buttons, cuffs.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Krasavichka Brammeilla" are convinced that it would be inappropriate for a uniformed serviceman to show up in a berated jacket, but if the talk is about "the leader from the group of those who are managing this event," then - "yes," it is such a thing in the topic.
If the employee's rank is lower, and his goal is to move up in the complex hierarchy of the company or to earn financial bonuses, it is better not to wear a jacket.
This guide is exactly assessing the phrase "not in Senki shapka," - think editors of Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous sensations from the voice.
This is an unnatural tone, so it is drawn.
And completely not associated with the cute face of a young girl.

The Big Seven pre-warned Russia about "massive consequences" in case of invasion in Ukraine
The countries of the "Big Seven" (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States and Japan) have published a statement on the results of the meeting of the foreign minister in Leverpule.
The document emphasizes that "military aggression" of Russia against Ukraine "will have far-reaching consequences and will cost a lot of money," but specific measures are not described in the document.
We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom and the United States, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military might and aggressive rhetoric regarding Ukraine," the statement reads.
Ministers urge Russia "to de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and adhere to their international obligations on transparency of military activity," about which President Biden spoke during a video conference with President Putin on December 7.
We confirm our support for France and Germany's efforts in Normandy format to achieve full implementation of Minsk agreements with the aim of resolving the conflict in Eastern Ukraine," the ministers of foreign affairs "Big Seven" declare.
Any use of force to change borders is forbidden by international law.
Russia should not doubt that the next military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious cost in response," they warn.
We confirm our unwavering commitment to sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement reads.

Pfizer's vaccine was 32 times less effective than the Omicron-strain
The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron-stammun of the coronavirus is 32 times lower than compared to other types of illness.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of Hong Kong came to this conclusion, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
Vaccines were considered less effective based on the study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
We see that the majority of people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly diminished against the omicron-variant," said Professor Malick Peryis.
Researchers emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier researchers at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of pandemic coronavirus, taking into account the impact of the omicron-stamp.
Authors of the study came to the conclusion that omicron-stamm may cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and increase mortality if not take additional measures.
The head of the Ukrainian military accused Germany in blocking the delivery of NATO weapons to Kyiv
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Aleksey Reznikov accused the government of the former Chancellor of FRG Angela Merkel in blocking the purchase of Kyiv's deadly weaponry within NATO.
In an interview with Financial Times on December 12, RÐµÐ·Ð½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð² reminded that Germany imposed a veto on Ukraine's purchase of anti-missile systems and missile launchers.
It is also noted that Berlin softened its position on guns, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kyiv intends to acquire the above-mentioned weaponry in accordance with bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, the talk is about the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Ukraine's arms deliveries remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's Ambassador to Germany Andrey Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not wait for Berlin's supply of weapons to Chancellor Scholz.
According to his words, the previous leadership of the FRG explained their refusal to provide weapons to the risk of escalation of military conflict in the Donbas, despite "occupation" of Russian territory.
The same "illogical" position, assured diplomat, Germany will keep and under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodimir Zelensky announced that Kiev expects assistance from Berlin in equipping the naval fleet.
Germany "will be a partner to Ukraine in the technological sense," the president said.
Also, it was noted that in the spring of the current year, the leader of the Green Party F.R.G., Robert Habek, visited the republic, where he spoke for the sale of Kyiv's defensive weapons.

Revealed ways to return stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to get your money back, stolen from online stores, and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were exposed by experts in information security in a conversation with RBK.
So, to reduce the risk of large losses due to the loss of bank cards in the hands of fraudsters, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Some savings can be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts recommend also to have a separate card for purchases in the network.
If money was stolen from purchases in stores that don't use 3D Secure, a refund can be initiated.
According to the rules established by payment systems, responsibility lies with the participant in the chain of payments who does not use the 3D Secure service," said a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Expert from international payment provider Ecommpay Arthur Zaremb pointed out that the buyer has the right to file a claim against fraudulent operation within 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator used a credit card on online resources that do not require two factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases internet stores themselves return money to the customer if the order has not been sent for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Council, Director of the League of Safe Internet, Ekaterina Mizulina reported that only in 2021 there were received 11,000 applications on various cases of fraud: from selling fake documents to stealing personal data.
According to her words, an effective solution in the current circumstances can be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and legislation of the EU
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants along the border with Belarus, the independence of the judicial authority in Poland, the increase of Russian troops along the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Northern Stream-2".
Although Scholz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland over the long term, leaders of the two countries expressed conflicting expectations.
Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Germany to oppose the Nord Stream 2 project, which calls for delivering Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravecsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin announced that it would help Warsaw and Brussels in regulating this crisis.
The judicial system of Poland, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreements.
The European Court has fined Poland for violating EU law, establishing that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the penalty, and its highest court ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn into office on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, did not take on itself public obligations to stop the Nord Stream 2 project in case of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they reached an understanding with Germany about halting the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, according to a high-ranking official in the U.S. on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz on Tuesday warned about the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's borders, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the "Big Seven" on Wednesday.

Our money in the church sanitary will pay 20 thousand dollars
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in Texas will receive a reward.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in a large evangelical church Leykwood, where the pastor Joel Austin, promising wealth and prosperity, is preaching.
In November 2021, plumbing technician Jastin Coulie repaired one of the church bathrooms and found hundreds of envelopes stuffed with cash and checks.
He handed the findings to the church and, according to his words, did not receive even gratitude from Ostin.
I wanted to hear him say, "Jastin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," the KPRC-TV quoted him.
The theft appears to be related to the theft that occurred in the Leakwood church seven years ago.
At that time about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks, which were kept in a church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer losses.
Nevertheless, for information about the criminals, a reward amounting to $25,000 was announced.
Jastin Coulie could not claim this sum, because the period of action of the award had already expired.
Despite this, the not-for-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, at one time offering a $5,000 reward, and later receiving another $20,000 in church donations, decided to reward honesty plumbing.
He will get 20 thousand dollars.
It was reported earlier that police questioned the pastor Joel Austin about money found in the wall of the Leakwood church.

In Brazil, citizens are required to present a passport vaccination upon entering the country
In Brazil, the requirement to require those entering the territory of the country to have a covid-passport, corresponding decision was made by the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Roberto Barrozo.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempted from the vaccination.
Also on the list of exclusions are people who arrived from countries where vaccination has been proved.
The situation is even more serious if you take into account that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for holiday, pre-Christmas, post-Christmas and carnival events, as well as other events that imply an increase in tourist traffic," said Barrosu.
Previously, Brazilian authorities required vaccinated tourists to observe five-day quarantine.
Revealed scheme of full protection from COVID-19
A virologist, doctor of medicine, a distinguished scientist of Russia Anatoly Altshteyn in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of full protection from coronavirus infection.
According to his words, this can be achieved by injecting a vaccine and using nasal vaccine.
When inter-national use is applied, immunoglobulins A are produced in large quantities. When the vaccine is injected, this does not occur.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate into the body.
And inside of us, after vaccination, the most immunoglobulins G (anti-antibodies) are formed.
And if you receive both vaccines, you will get many immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no resolution about double vaccination," said the doctor.
The main prophylacticologist of the UrFo, doctor of medical sciences Sergey Tokarev, in his turn, said that the main advantage of nasal vaccination together with intranasal vaccination is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help those that in such a case the defense of the organism, presumably, should be maximized.
Minister of health of Nizhgorod region Davit Melik-Guseynov said that the new surge of COVID-19 will lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to his words, such a picture is observed in other countries, where another wave of pandemia came earlier.

Don't believe it.
I had many owners who stopped me from chasing the dog, although they claimed that they were going to walk 200 thousand (pomskies), but they grabbed my hand and led me in a different direction.
In the end, "200 thousand" chose the owner, and not the dog, which ran somewhere.
Protests against vaccination continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and plans of authorities to make vaccination from COVID obligatory.
In February next year unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine in the amount of 3600 euros.
Spanish citizens, angered by the politics of health authorities in Madrid, marched peacefully in Madrid.
Some held placards with the inscription "This is a false pandemic," "I won't be vaccinated."
A large protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In autonomous communities, COVID certification is required for access to bars, restaurants, sports facilities, homes for the elderly and nighttime entertainment venues.
The decision to issue sanitary passports authorities in a number of regions of the country was taken in the face of the rise in the number of cases of infection with the coronavirus.
In Luxembourg more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR-codes.
The protest began peacefully, but then escalated into confrontations with security forces.
A group of demonstrators threw stones at police.

WHO has detected "monkeypox" already in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the new strain of coronavirus "Omicron" has been found in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of a new strain may have catastrophic consequences.
The pace of spread of the strain was reported in a WHO report.
According to the organization, on December 9, the number of cases was detected in 63 countries, in all six regions of the WHO.
That it became actively spreading only from the end of November.
The WHO also expressed concern about the rapid spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
Experts at the World Health Organization express concern that a new strain may surpass the spread of the delta strain, which is the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently spreading in all countries without exception.
The head of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhamon Gebreysius said that the monkey-spreading virus can have a significant impact on the course of the pandemic.
The same conclusions were also found in the United Kingdom.
Experts at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will overtake "deluth" in the next few months.
The number of those infected only in the UK amounts to around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "omicron" is currently in the UK afflicted by several hundred people, and according to estimated figures, up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the strain "omicron," and in peak in hospitals will be discharged more than 2,000 people daily.
Britain's health system will not be able to cope with this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from the company Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain "omicron" is 32 times lower than in comparison with other types of illness.
It's not known how the Russian Satellite V will react to the Omikron, but it will become clear in the next few days.
The Center for Gamalei only began testing the Russian vaccine on the strain "Omicron".

Russian warns about new scheme of fraudsters
Criminals are looking for new ways to deceive in video communications.
This is reported by "News" with a reference to experts.
According to the director of products at the company Ivideon Zaur Abutylimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communications is DVRs.
In this case, the fraudsters create fake videos based on real recordings with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the peculiarities of behavior of that or any person.
Abuatilov added that using a disphaker, malicious actors can make calls to known victims via video conferencing or create a video with a copy of the person for the purpose of extortion.
Such frauds can easily lead to bullying, because a fraudster can place people in risky, dangerous or compromising scenarios," the expert said.
Systemic engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkol noted that psychologically people more trust others when they see them.
He underscored that this could create specific risks in the case of video technologies.

Five actions that can help avoid diabetes
Problems with sugar levels in the blood - one of the most common in the world.

Doctor Pavlova told about "migrain exit day" at workholics
The worsening of self-awareness in holidays can be caused by several factors
The reason for worsening health after working days is often "migraine on the day off," said a famous endocrinologist, PhD, senior scientific researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine MGU, senior scientific researcher at the Clinic of Systemic Medicine Zura Pavlova in his telegram-canal.
According to her words, especially often from this suffer from hard-working people, who experience headache, dizziness and weakness.
Dr. Pavlova noted that, in addition to the accumulated fatigue, there are plenty of objective reasons for a negative reaction of the body to changing conditions.
Our lives change fundamentally on weekends.
We sleep for a long time, lying on the sofa, probably we eat more, and we drink less, - the doctor argued. - Because of the lack of coffee, a small ache begins.
Because of overeating and lack of water - heaviness and brokenness.
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you stand up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction, which is called jet lag.
It occurs to travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factor plays the dominant role in affecting one's well-being, Pavlova recommended to track what changes the most.

How much hidden sugar in common products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
His excessive intake may lead to diabetes of the second type, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under an unfamiliar word in the product there may be hidden sugar - ingredient, analogous to sugar by calories, composition, and glycemic index.
On the label, there may be several dozens of names, indicating sugar.
One of the most common and frequently encountered names is glucose and frucose.
There may also be other sugars, such as dextrose (sugar made from corn syrup), levulose (fruit sugar), melasse (cane sugar), agave (cane sugar) and so on.
These are simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionary items, but also in cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese
According to Russia, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed food, as well as pay attention to the labeling and variety of sugar names.
Different varieties of sugar differ in taste, but no matter how it is called the ingredient in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it remains sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, because you have to take into account not only the amount of sugar stated on the package, but also the amount of sugar contained in the fruit, vegetables, etc.
This way, the total amount of sugar may be considerably higher than what is indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas loses importance for Germany within 25 years
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the import of gas loses importance for Germany, as the country continues to transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to his words, Germany plans to completely give up gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
Within 25 years the world will be such that transportation of gas in FRG and Europe will play a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to the fact that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas, and in the future, this resource has an important significance for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the United States made a statement in which they declared support for Berlin's energy transformation of Ukraine.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany Annalena Berbock announced that the process of certification of the gas pipeline "Northern Stream - 2" continues.
According to the minister, during the coalition negotiations and discussions on the coalition agreement, it was announced that the European law should be applied to the energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline does not meet the requirements of the European Union.

The referendum in New Caledonia overwhelmingly voted against independence
The third referendum in New Caledonia, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first preliminary results, announced on Sunday, December 12, in the afternoon, most residents of New Caledonia voted in favor of independence from their territory.
The level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted "for" independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762 people) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 citizens of New Caledonia participating in the elections.
According to the France-Presse agency, "these interim results do not leave room for doubt," as independent supporters called voters not to participate in the vote.
As initiators of a referendum, they opposed its conduct on December 12, believing that a new outbreak of COVID-19 on the archipelago hinders a full-fledged and "truthful" election campaign.
Such a way, this non-participation opened the way to the third victory of the supporters of the French New Caledonia, after referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, against independence voted 56.7% citizens, in 2020 - 53.3%.
As separatists said, they do not recognize the results of the last election and will contest them in the UN.
As it was announced on Sunday, December 12, in the Elysee Palace, President Emmanuel Macron should give a speech on the results of this referendum.
The independence of New Caledonia has in many ways revived the last few weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several candidates for president have spoken up in favor of keeping the territory within France, as it is "the last region of presence in the European Union in the T
New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour said repeatedly.
This statement was made by the Republican candidate Valerie Peckresse, who published an article in Le Figaro at the end of October, urging citizens to remain French.
On his own side, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position, "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the president added: "France would have been more beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, on his side, expressed "strong desire to make the choice of CalÃ©dons be a choice of France".

WSJ readers criticized the article about relations between Russia and USA
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized the article of professor Christopher Hartswell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern about the fact that the West allegedly brings Ukraine to the sacrifice of Russia.
In his article, he warns readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and allowed a number of insulting remarks against the Russian president Vladimir Putin.
At the end of Hartwell, he called Western countries to "stand together as one front against Russia".
Readers of WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of an American professor.
In this article there is a lot of misinformation," said one of the readers, according to RIA Novosti.
Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," the other said.

Ukraine will begin to produce jet fighters of new generation
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, they will begin to create reactive jet-powered aircraft (BPLA) of type ANKA.
This was announced on December 11 by an advisor to the head of the office of the Ukrainian President Aleksey Arestovich.
They are able to act against aerial objects, against other bees.
Even against aviation piloted.
They will be powered by Ukrainian engines and other Turkish aviation: the body and other similar things," quotes him Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA, Arestovich said that the talk is about reactive, not propulsive BPLAs.
According to his words, this new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceeds his "by all characteristics".
The first batch of BPLAs should be produced by the factory by the end of next year, said Arestovich.
The ANKA was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the unmanned aircraft was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On Tuesday, the Ukrainian General Staff revealed data on the use of Bayraktar missiles and Javelin rockets during military operations united forces in Donbas.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodimir Zelensky announced that construction of a factory for the production of modern military drones has begun in the country.
According to his words, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian military signed an agreement to build a center in Kyiv Oblast, in which training of personnel, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish UAVs Bayraktar will take place.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a big real step forward."
Two lions escaped from a cage at the airport
At the Singapore airport Changi, escaped lions.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two hunters managed to escape from the cage with seven lions, arriving on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the fleeing lions lay down on the roof of the container.
They couldn't get away from him because of the protective netting.
The confrontation ended after the arrival of the employees of the Mandai Wildlife Group, who are responsible for all Singapore zoological parks.
They have immobilized lions with tranquilizers and are planning to bring them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier, it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a leopard escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
That same day, the bear voluntarily returned home, people were not harmed.
Experts warn of cancer risk from vitamin B9
Vitamin B9 deficiency, also known as folic acid, may lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is evidence that people who do not have a deficiency of folic acid, are less likely to get certain types of cancer, such as colorectal.
However, excessive doses on the contrary promote the growth of cancerous cells.
Professor at the University of Alabam in Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchin advises to watch the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only in that case, if significantly deviate from this figure in a bigger or smaller way.
Kitschin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without doctor's recommendation, always watch the dosage and avoid food products that contain folic acid.
Earlier consultant on nutrition Raychel Fain called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Because it, among other things, contains avocado, Fain recommended men over 50 years more often to eat this fruit.
Up to 75,000 people could die in the U.K. from April due to the omicron-strain
British scientists predict that up to 75,000 people could die in the next five months in Britain if the restrictive measures are not tightened up in the winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, citing a study by experts at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the scientific-consultative group for extreme situations at the British Cabinet Ministers, by April 2022, the country will have recorded at least 25 deaths from the strain of Omicron, and the total hospitalized will be around 175,000 patients.
At this point, the hospitals will be taking in more than 2,000 infected daily.
Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may require the National Health Service to be overloaded if the omicron variant becomes more infectious than the variant delta, and existing vaccines cannot prevent infections, said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
The Agency for Public Health in the United Kingdom informed earlier that if the speed of the spread of the Omicron strain remains at the current level, there will be about one million cases of infection by the end of the year in the country.
By mid-December, the Omicron variant may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
There are 1,898 cases of coronavirus in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
On December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that this indicator may already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superyachts has risen in the world by a quarter
Construction of super-housing in this year and orders for next year break all records, despite calls to reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change.
The world register of yachts totaled 1,200 units - by a quarter more than last year.
It's hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for floating stability for $50 million dollars and above will decrease, writes "Guardian".
However, they become more and more.
This year saw a 25% increase in the number of ships ordered, compared to the previous year.
Brokers say that such a frenzy on the market has not been seen in 20 years.
The first reason is that many people who can afford to charter a yacht are afraid of infection on the sea and prefer to hide from the pandemic on the deck of their own yacht.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with partners in business, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and meetings are conducted via Zoom.
Broker William Christie told the newspaper that the marina took orders for new yachts in 2025 and beyond.
This means that the charterers are willing to pay more, provided that their yacht is ready by the year or two earlier.
People just want freedom, and the super-rich can afford it, he says.
In western society many criticize such behavior of rich people and call it decadent.
The wealthy, according to sociologists, do not want to understand that in the era of space travel, life on yachts or flights on their own aircraft causes discontent, because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists urge governments to act and suggest new taxes and regulations, although they understand that it will be difficult to implement this in a mobile economy.
Meanwhile, the number of booked superyachts, but their characteristics.
Out of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a length of the keel above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke builds yacht REV Ocean measuring 183 meters.
After launching on the water, this will be the biggest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a lunar bathing pool, as well as a submersible boat, intended for exploring ocean depths.
Existing superyachts feature helipads for helicopters, movie theaters under an open sky, and on some of them, such as the yacht of MacGregor - a platform for wrestling matches. Professor of anthropology at an American university in Indiana Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of carbon emissions, the carbon footprint, produced by superyachts, is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance, if you consider that the multi-billionaires in the world are just a little more than 2000 people.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that emission trails of billionaires are thousands of times more than the average citizen of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 per year, Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
Two-thirds of emissions were traced to his yacht Eclipse, which is 162.5 meters long.
Even if the owner of the yacht is not on board, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to sail the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
The owners of superyachts do not elicit sympathy from other people when they, as the richest woman in Australia Diana Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, boasts through YouTube that their giant yachts do not have space for mooring.
It's also hard to understand her appeal to build marinas for ships with a length of 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol, leading to the development of stomach cancer
American scientists have determined that the amount of alcoholic beverages in a week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts came to the conclusion that the consumption of four or more drinks of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with increased risk of cancer.
The likelihood of developing the disease increases as the amount of alcohol consumed increases.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of colon cancer than women.
Scientists can't pinpoint the exact cause of this type of cancer, noting that certain factors can lead to a cancerous process.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
Even though they don't realize it, four-legged pets are at the heart of the matter.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to try to find out how intelligence develops in animals.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, however new research shows that a dog can react to 89 words or phrases.
The researchers' findings were published in the journal Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or compose poetry, nothing makes sense in politics, economy and art, but they often manage to deceive their own owners.
Representatives of some breeds, according to experts, show the best results in understanding human language, but statistical data for accurate conclusions are insufficient.
Some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and their ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine prepared for trading with the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will "trade" on the issue of Ukraine's entry into NATO, said analyst Alexander Kotsyuk in his article for the publication "Glavred".
According to him, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on the issue of guarantees of the United States regarding the fact that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right to decide where to go.
If you are offered something that is obviously unacceptable, such as selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not negotiate, but just throw away the offer.
In terms of Ukraine, there is a trade," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kyiv.
The preparations are carried out secretly, quickly and immediately, and they don't wait until the groupings are discovered and reverse forces are activated," he said.
China stimulates the development of railway transport
Advanced Chinese technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France, and other countries at the Chinese International Railway and Equipment Exhibition 2021, held in Chuzhou City, Hunan Province.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical defects, said a representative of the company Hou Zhauen.
High-speed trains, operating on the railway line China-Laos, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies that will ensure enhanced reliability and operability of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway transportation equipment, and many countries in Asia and Europe have become witnesses to "Chinese speed".
In May this year, the company CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd produced the first two-car high-speed electric trains, designed for export to Europe.
At the maximum working speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on Austrian, German, Hungarian and other European countries railways.
In November, a trial operation of the metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will move along the metroline connecting the center of StamÐ±Ñla with the airport of the city.
Movement on this metro line will be opened in the following year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
Chinese equipment manufacturing for railway transportation is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international competitiveness, said Fan Yao Shan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of China Committee for Promoting International Trade.
This segment constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese manufacturing of high-class equipment on the global market," said Feng Yao-shan.
After more than 60 years of intense work, China has created a state-of-the-art equipment manufacturing system for railway transportation, with a full set of supporting tools and a large-scale production activity.
According to Fan Yao, the country takes the first place in the level of electrification of railways and the exploitation of high-speed railways and urban railways.
Biologist points out early signs of dementia
Candidate biologist Semy Goloshikin in an interview with radio Sputnik listed early signs of dementia.
According to his words, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of mild cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and a decrease in abstract thinking.
A discussion is currently underway about whether hearing loss can be an early sign of Alzheimer's, or one of the risk factors for its onset, said a specialist.
Goloshkin emphasized that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, deficiency of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain's arteries are the most common causes of this syndrome.
A biologist noted that today, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start her preventive measures.
According to his words, the risk of dementia can be lowered by studying foreign languages and active communication.
Also, the WHO recommends maintaining moderate levels of physical exertion, regularly exercising cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense cognitive engagement.
There are recommendations for the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being discussed in the scientific community," said Goloshikin.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies, requiring intense involvement of memory and cognition, said Goloshnikin.
A UK-based charity researching dementia has said that the disease is affecting people in their 40s.
Medik called early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first sign of trouble is vision problems, due to which the patient has difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dyslexia is aphasia - the condition when a person cannot find the right words to say what they want to say.
Neurologist required to send Saakashvili to treatment abroad
The former president of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili, needs psychotherapy and rehabilitation abroad, said the journalist, neurologist Otar Toidze, who belongs to the council of doctors, created by the government of Georgia.
His neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
Stability problems include problems with mobility, coordination, variability of character," said the expert, noting that this does not fall within normative limits and now the ex-president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
This we call neuro-rehabilitation and psychoneuro-rehabilitation, the possibility of which in Georgia we did not find," said Toidze, requiring Saakashvili to be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage receiving medical assistance after the staff of penitentiary service punished him disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel punishment and restore himself in previous rights.

A steep climb: how Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help create international resorts.
China hopes that the Olympic Games will not only attract 300 million citizens to participate in winter sports, which will allow President Xi Jinping to collect 1 trillion yuan, but also promote economic development in remote provinces.
The ski resort Taivu in Changchengou, located not far from the site of the Winter Olympic Games, becomes more popular among Chinese people.
Besides construction of infrastructure in the region, work is being carried out on landscaping: trees are being planted.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competition.
In many regions of China, where ski resorts are located, including Changchengkou, there are snow problems.
The main goal for long-term perspective is to ensure comfortable and interesting holidays on Chinese resorts so that all newbies become regulars.
But there's still a long way to go.
Adviser to the Games Jastin Dowans says that the Chinese skiing industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year during the winter, more and more Chinese go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Peking, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many more years to create a skiing culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation.
70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Chunli, near the site of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago from Peking to Chunli they built a high-speed railway, now no one of the local residents is suffering from unemployment.
In the country, more and more stores are opening, selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, they open restaurants with national cuisine.
There is now even a testing station for COVID-19 on Taivu.
China is striving to create a prosperous industry of winter sports, its athletes should become leaders of major international competitions, and the country's infrastructure and equipment should reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, said WHO
More than 500 million people in the world may be plunged into extreme poverty due to the pandemic caused by the coronavirus, which has slowed the progress of humanity, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In light of the December 12 International Day of Universal Access to Health Care, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic led to disruptions in health care services, caused excessive strain on health systems.
In this context, for the first time in 10 years, the population immunization decreased, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
The WHO and WB have highlighted that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so people have become harder to pay for treatment," they said.
This situation pushes more than 50 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their pockets."
United Nations General Secretary AntÃ³nio Guterrez said in October that the pandemic of coronavirus has caused more than 100 million people to go into poverty, more than four million people practically have no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister disqualified from broadcasting on "Sammi the Democracy" on request of White House
Minister of digital technologies Taiwan's Odri Tan's speech at a panel discussion during the U.S. "Summit for Democracy" was translated into video, according to a YouTube recording.
The Reuters Agency, citing sources, says the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the map that Taiwan was designated as a separate color from China, which considers the island as its territory.
The map, which showed the governor Tan, was drawn by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world according to the degree of fulfillment of civil rights.
Taiwan was designated as "free," and China, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam were designated as "closed."
After the minister showed the map, a screenshot with her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of participants of the discussion "do not necessarily represent the position of the United States government."

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported about "painful withdrawal" in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with "Izvestia" assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the lengthy path of interaction has led to unfortunate outcomes, and problems between the two countries began today.
One-sided negative predictability is there, but at some point in some perspective of improving relations, it is completely unpredictable.
This is a lamentable outcome after a long journey, which we went through and with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems started yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the U.S. attempt to impose Russia's approach on a number of issues.
The State Department's Undersecretary added that he did not dare to give optimistic forecasts about the prospects of improving relations and did not expect any change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cyber security, progress is not observed.
Russia urges the United States to take a responsible approach in matters of international security and hopes that signals will be heard, and Americans will pay attention to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov at a meeting with the American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
The virologist warned about the danger of vaccination with the nasal spray from COVID in hospitals
People vaccinated with the nasal vaccine for COVID-19 may develop allergies and they may need help from doctors, so the first points for vaccination with this vaccine should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virusologist, member-correspondent of the Academy of Sciences, member of the Laboratory of Biotechnology, Microbiology and Virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netsev.
It's easier to organize vaccination points at airports and shopping centers, but I would do it at the first time only in medical facilities.
The reason is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to this vaccine is small, but it is desirable that the person sits next to the cabinet of the doctor.
Doctors have special sets of antiallergic medications that act almost immediately, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netsev.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when there will be accumulated experience in using the drug.
He also emphasized that it is important that the nasal vaccine gets into the mucous membrane in the nasal pass.
However, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its intended destination if the vaccinated person sneezes after the nasal swab is inserted.

Peskov warned about the suffering of western countries, which introduce anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of the continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the possible "intrusion" into the territory of the country.
It's impossible to impose restrictions against Russia and not experience suffering oneself," said the Kremlin's official representative on the TV channel "Russia 1".

WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers that "Omicron" is less dangerous than delta-stampm coronavirus.
Along with this, there are data on the decreased efficacy of vaccines against the new variant of COVID-19.
According to information on December 9, "Omicron" is registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and significantly altered antigenic profile of the vaccine strain "Omicron" allow to assume a decrease in efficacy of the vaccine against infection and transmission variant.
According to the preliminary findings from South Africa, it may be less severe than the "disease" - said in the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all cases of infection with "monkeypox" in Europe have been mild or symptomless.
Along with that, a new strain, according to preliminary estimates, spreads more quickly "delts."
Two cases of omicron-stammom have been registered in Russia.
They were immunized earlier, the Center said.
The head of the Russian Food and Drug Monitoring Agency, Anna Popova, said that there are no reliable data about the fact that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine named four scenarios for Zelensky
Former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko outlined four variants of development of events for President of Ukraine Volodimir Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the head of state can remain without support from the West, and also, perhaps, will go to a compromise on the Donbas.
This on Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called "ideal storm," implies that Ukraine will be supported by key western countries, reaching an agreement about the future of the country without its participation.
This development of events will contribute to a deep crisis, with which Kyiv can face in 2023.
Parallelly, there is a decrease in the prices of key goods, which we traditionally export, internal protests and opposition of power with key financial-industrial groups (financial-industrial groups. - Red.)," said the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in case of high turbulence in world politics, where Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this situation, the Ukrainian leadership may go to a compromise on the Donbas, resulting in a conflict within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's positions weakened, according to the former deputy, the likelihood of such situation, according to the words of the former deputy, amounts to 50-55%.
The third option of development of the situation in Ukrainian politics - opposition to the Zelensky group of population and the president, because of which there is a possibility of seizure of control over the power bloc and realization of "populist initiatives".
During this variant of crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting of power," said Denisenko.
Another script - the transformation of Zelensky into "father of the nation".
This may be caused by some event that will become a strong shock to society.
The event should be large enough to trigger a reaction from external partners and cause an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
This variant of development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, technogenic catastrophe or aggressive actions of Russia, says the former deputy.
The Russian side has already rejected any possibility of "aggression" against Ukraine.
In Moscow, they noted that the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States are increasing military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier on November 11, data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to the lowest values, reaching 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since the election of the head of state.
Analysts predict a situation in which in case of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, Zelensky would get his votes only 21.8%, while for the ex-president of the country Petr Poroshenko - 14.5%.
Only 19.3% of those polled supported the president.

In the beginning of the week for ten days they arrested 21-year-old poet Alexander Volochenkov.
A student at WSE was detained on the Red Square with a placard, on which was written hashtag #poetroisbiggerthanpoet.

On Alexander, a protocol was drawn up for an administrative article about a repeat violation of public order.
The first time he was detained 23 January on Pushkinskaya Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
The goal was to attract attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, lost, and the decline of culture in Russia and so little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems under this hashtag," Alexander explains.
We spoke with a young poet to find out the circumstances of detention and more fully reveal the messaging of his message.
How were you treated by police officers when you were detained this time and previously?
What did they ask in the department, how they commented on your action?
This time, the employees were more correct, the detention was maximum, polite, as it sounded in some context.
On the Pushkinskaya they took OMON officers and took them hard.
They asked standard questions about motivation.
When we heard, in principle, we looked at if we didn't approve it, then we understood.

And if after the action under this hashtag they start to write their poems, though a few people, I these 10 days I will not waste my time.

Researchers say potatoes help fight age-related problems
Research has shown that potatoes are rich in vitamins and microelements that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphor, calcium, magnesium, riboflavine and pantothenic acid.
All of these elements help the organism function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related problems.

Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the search "Yandex"
Candidates for the flight

Estonian scientists will search life on Venus
Massachusettian Technology Institute, in collaboration with Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus for searching signs of life in the atmosphere, announced on Sunday.
The goal of the five-year mission is to assess the habitability of Venus for life, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tarutian scientists proposed instruments for measuring acidity and oxygen content in Venus clouds.
Until now, it was assumed that Venus, the nearest planet to Earth, was too acidic to support life, but it is likely that originally Venus was a terrestrial planet.
During the third mission, a sample should arrive from Venus.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be - is it similar to earthly or different.
If very similar, then it will be obvious that the terrestrial life began on the Earth.
If it is different, then it may be more likely that life originated on Earth," said the leader of the Estonian team project "Venus Life Finder" Mikhkhel Pajusalu.

Metaverse will change the Russian business
The metaverse became popular this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market, this event became a significant signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new digital interaction between people.
As a result, business in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Meta-universe should be considered as a continuation of existing trends.
On one side, trend on creating distant interactions in the pandemic, because people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a result of the desire of businesses to develop ecosystems and adapt them to operational models.
The third - they are logical continuation of the trend of digitization of assets, when any rights, valuable bonds, works of art and even money move into digital format.

British economist couldn't give forecast for 2022 year
British economist Jim O'Neill couldn't give a forecast for 2022 year, because, according to his opinion, similar attempts will result in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
An expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change.
The most important factor is the pandemic of the coronavirus, and on the second place - inflation, according to him.
O'Neill also admitted that he didn't know whether the increase in prices was temporary or permanent.
According to the expert, it was already clear before the pandemic that "the world infinite generosity of central banks had exhausted itself" and it was time to return to relations where interest rates adjusted to inflation would match the expected growth of GDP.
O'Neill noted that amid the pandemic, continued excessive economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new spike in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the question of increasing productivity, as well as increasing the level of poverty and changing the climate, O'Neill said.
The head of the department of global research "Opening Investments" Mikhail Shulgin said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate in 2022 remain, although the potential growth will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin named the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices and the fears over the pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
I had to agree.
But one thing pleases me: if you compare yourself with yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.

Russia gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of the first 10 months of 2021, Russians spent on the purchase of new vehicles 2 trillion 784 billion rubles, which by 28% more than the same period of the previous year, according to the statistical data of the Agency of Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - roughly the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the government to support citizens and economy during the pandemic.
In September, at a meeting of the heads of state in the Shanghai Organization of Cooperation, President Vladimir Putin said that such a sum is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020.
Korean brand Kia leads by revenues on the Russian market.
In the first 10 months of this year, he managed to implement cars at a sum of 32.5 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the previous year.
The related Kia brand Hyundai's growth is even more significant - more than 35%, and the revenue from sales of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
On the leading positions this brand and by increasing the average selling price of the automobile - for a year Hyundai grew by almost 21%, up to 1,94 million rubles - stronger dynamics of price increase was only at Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
However, the volume of sales from Korean brands grew less significantly: according to the statistics of the European Automotive Manufacturers Association in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars than the year before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Japanese Toyota - the leader in terms of volume of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles for 10 months, which is 14% more than a year ago.
The Japanese Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand grew and the volume of sales (by 37%) and the average price of the car (almost by 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
While Mercedes-Benz is simultaneously experiencing a good growth in sales and average prices - more, for example, than at BMW - from this reason and greater growth in financial equity, said the director of NAPI Tatiana Arabadzh.
According to the pace of growth in sales, fantastic figures are shown by Chinese brands, which have significantly increased their financial capacity this year.
Russian Lada by dynamics of growth of revenues demonstrates middle-range indicators (plus 28%), on the cars of this brand Russians spent for 10 months 229.4 billion rubles.
Companies with financial woes, such as Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan, saw their sales fall: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and altogether in the minus - for 10 months the Russians have spent on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year ago.
Against the backdrop of the problems with the supply of automotive components and disruptions in production, the automotive companies continue to uninterruptedly adjust prices - the same "AvtoVaz" raised the price of models Lada seven times in a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Regularly price their products and other auto producers.
The car market in Russia in monetary terms will continue to grow and further - besides the shortage of cars, the inflation, and the desire of car manufacturers to recover past losses, experts say.
In the face of a shortage of vehicles, I think that many automobile manufacturers have been able to pass on the cost of previous periods, which they couldn't include in the price of vehicles earlier,
Analyst "VTB Capital" Vladimir Bespalov says.
I believe that automobile manufacturers feel themselves very well right now, maintaining high margins.
The implicit indicator of this is the pace of growth of car prices, which is observed in 2021, car prices are growing faster than inflation, says the expert.
In the long-term perspective, the market will grow and in quantitative terms, and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and complexity of the machines, predicts Bespalov.
With the increase in demand, opportunities for raising prices will be limited.
The Russian automotive market will continue to grow in the future, even if the growth of vehicle prices slows, automotive producers will be able to earn their profits based on the volume of sales, says an independent consultant on the automotive market Sergey Burzhgalev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, automobile manufacturers are striving to get the highest profit per each sold vehicle, notes Burgaizliyev.
Increases in production volumes of machines is not expected in the next few months, while in Russia the heating up of citizens in the future is still uncertain.
On the back of a deteriorating situation on the market, automobiles have become a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with a mileage, now can be sold for more than the initial price, says the expert.
Biden spoke about the transfer of U.S. military to Ukraine in case of invasion of Russia
U.S. never considered sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in case of "invasion" by Russia.
The president of the United States, Joe Biden, made such an announcement.
There has never been such plans," said the head of the White House, responding to a question from a reporter about whether the United States had rejected such an idea.
Biden noted that in case of escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
He also emphasized that the United States and NATO do not have obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops in a unilateral way for defense of Ukraine in the future does not stand.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will send forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungaria, Latvia, Lithia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Estonia).
We need to deploy more U.S. and NATO forces to the eastern flank, B9 - all NATO countries, in relation to which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia," said Biden.
Earlier press secretary of the president of Russia Dmitry Peskov emphasized that there are no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
He also pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in Kiev's use of Turkish drones, as well as in the fact that "American weaponry is approaching our territory."
