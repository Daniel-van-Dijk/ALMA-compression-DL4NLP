Academic conference at Zhejiang University, students sing the leading role, research achievements make people's brains open - New China
Use air to wash your hands, diagnose illness, and find sources of haze and smog. Yesterday evening, at the University of Zhejiang 2016 academic year conference, a series of academic achievements were awarded.
These researchers are mostly students, and their research covers a wide range of environmental, machinery, energy, health, medicine, education, and many other fields, and the students started from a good idea. They have created many high-end discoveries with great value. Some projects have been awarded in China and internationally.
Biological sensors: your home medical check
Zhang Diyan, a doctoral student at the Biomedical Engineering Institute, demonstrated a smartphone with a bio-sensing device, which was only half the size of a smartphone.
All you need to do is exhale a little breath, and this device will be able to detect your body's health condition from the breath you exhale.
Zhang Dei explained that the sensor and smartphone are connected, and the health report will be displayed on the smartphone.
Smart watches that can measure health conditions can generally measure temperature, pulse, and other physical parameters.
This group of biological sensors uses a new type of material, namely graphite, its target is chemical elements, which makes it can more deeply and accurately detect the health condition of the body.
Intelligent surgical light: the doctor's high energy eyes
Besides the smartphone, the surgery room is also using the smart surgery lamp.
This invention won a silver award at this year's 44th Swiss International Invent Exhibition.
Lighting and Electrical Science and Engineering Institute Master's Student Zhu Lin Ji and Shen Jun Fei Team started a new path in the deficiency of traditional lighting lamp. They discovered intelligent LED lighting lamp.
Many early-stage screening and surgical excision are not carried out, and the light used in the operating room is related to the surgeons.
Sun Yunfei said that when the tumor is detected at an early stage, the doctor may not be able to see all the tumor masses, and then the tumor cells will spread.
This type of intelligent light bulb has four lamps, by adjusting the light spectrum, to strengthen the different composition of the light illuminated area.
During surgery, the surgeon can adjust the brightness of the light source according to the need of the surgery and the habit of the surgeon. The brightness of the light source can be adjusted according to the need of the surgery and the habit of the surgeon. The brightness of the light source can be adjusted according to the need of the surgery and the habit of the surgeon. The brightness of the light source can be adjusted according to the need of the surgery and the habit of the surgeon. The brightness of the light source can be adjusted according to the need of the surgery and the habit of the surgeon. The brightness of the light source can be adjusted according to the need of the surgery and the habit of the surgeon.

This type of intelligent surgical light has been used in the affiliated hospitals of the University of Zhejiang Medical College, University of Zhejiang Medical College, affiliated children's hospital and other hospitals, and received good feedback.
Last year, this invention won the National Innovation Award.
Use air to wash hands: save water and cool
Common people wash their hands by washing them with water, rub some soap, and wash their hands with hand soap. Li Qingchang and other students also revealed a set of "air washing hands device".
All we have to do is stand on the hand-washing station, and our weight will be compressed out.
It's like a balloon.
The compressed air, at the water dragon's mouth, forms a flowing body, and the water combines with it.
This way, we can wash our hands clean!
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiment proves that through this method, the effect of washing hands is the same as the common washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own weight for propulsion, and not only ensures washing efficiency, but also saves up to 90% of water, and the whole process is completely waste-free.
Last year, at the Second Global Summit of the World's Highest Peaks, this project emerged from a number of world's highest peaks, and won the only gold medal.
Please arrange to send back to me as soon as possible. Thank you.
Please cancel the order and refund the money, do not accumulate points, after that you will not use #PRS_ORG#!
Bones and spicy cabbage are not suitable for young children to eat.
If it is, order as soon as possible.
At the moment, there is no one.
He called me to tell you where he is#PRS_ORG#
I didn't wait, I cancelled the order

It's good, it's annoying.
I feel that there is a lot of meaning in this book - an emergency certificate
This is one of the documents that I have except the driver's license that is one of the most important documents that I have!
Quickly: the emergency response is an emergency response in the event of an emergency, i.e. before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a certain period of time after the accident has occurred, and it is this period of time that is the most important.
This is the time when you need to be rescued.
If I really have a heart disease, brain hemorrhage, I will only have four minutes, yellow gold four minutes!
So, the people around me know how important it is to get help as soon as possible!
When we are surrounded by people falling down, we can use professional knowledge to help them, rather than standing still and doing nothing, this feeling of helplessness is too scary.
In China, we have official data of 300,000 deaths per year, the most dangerous is heart stoppage.
In the United States, about 15% of the population can be rescued.
In the gambling casino in Las Vegas, 78% can get out of it, Shanghai and Beijing below 1%.
This is the first reaction founder Liu Lu said.
If a person has a heart stopp, you can't breathe, you can't breathe, you can't do anything.
To save a person, it is necessary to do artificial breathing and chest compression.
I find that we are still few people who have this kind of awareness to learn rescue, but it is too late when an emergency happens, so we should all learn this skill, so that we can be prepared when an emergency happens.
It may be able to save a person's life.
You can sign up for the Red Cross training center in your local Red Cross training center, I am signed up for the Red Cross training center in Shanghai. Students also have a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the targets that need to be completed before the age of 25, and the emergency certificate was added to the target list a few months ago, but it was completed!
Next, I want to go to take the other certificates. I want to take the diving certificate. I saw that there was a diving emergency certificate before. It seems that the diving emergency certificate is useful.
I ordered #NUMBER#.
There are 13 yen of shrimp dumplings for one!?
I've never tried.
How does #NAME# not write clearly?
One for 13?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# leaked food, this time just one fish dumpling for me to eat!?
Because when I entered the code, I saw that it was effective.
First of all, I believe that "Four Seas" is a full-fledged bad movie, from various aspects, it is.
But you have to say that this movie is not a bright spot and it's not at least a good choice.
There are many kinds of trash, and one of them is to let you sleep in the movie theater, and another one is to let you watch it after it is over, and "Four Seas" is like a monkey in the mountains, and it can use many ways to ignite your anger.
On this point, the Koreans are really gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it resembles a creature from a science-fiction novel, and it is difficult to name it. It looks like a jacket on a horse's back.
After you have finished watching it, you will have doubts that there is a hidden implication behind it, but when you carefully think about it, you will find that it is just a cover-up.
I'll try to explain some of the details that are hard for me to understand.
The man's home should be in a small island somewhere in the south, and he and his mother should be dependent on each other.
She wanted to see the snow, and then the drama was arranged for her to go to the northeast to see the snow.
An elderly person sits on a bread wagon from the south to the north to see snow?
He and his father are very confident about this.
After that, this old man didn't say anything.
Opening a bar on a derelict ship, how does the owner get a liquor license?
Why is it so easy to drive a mountain road to a closed road?
After that, the crane truck stopped in the middle of the road, and the crane truck drivers couldn't find the crane truck.
This tool is too obvious.
Why would a non-credible suspect become a police officer?
In the face of high interest rates, the police asked whether there was any difficulty.
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to open a hotel room door, and then forces himself to find the hotel manager and sleep in the hotel room?
This bizarre situation is all over the entire film, because it's so far from reality that it's almost impossible to remember it.
Besides the plot, the worst thing about the film is that it has no theme, or to put it simply, the film has no theme.
At the beginning, you will think that he wants to make a comedy film, and after 20 minutes, you will guess that it is a romantic film, and then you will think that it may be a depiction of a small town young people's existence, and after watching, you will not know what you think about it.
Most people are familiar with a variety of film genres, for example, if you want to shoot a motorcycle, then you should be familiar with a variety of film genres, for example, if you want to tell a story about a talented bird, then you should be familiar with a variety of film genres, for example, if you want to tell a story about a talented bird, then you should be familiar with a variety of film genres, for example, if you want to tell a story about a talented bird, then you should be familiar with a variety of film genres, for example, if you want to tell a story about a talented bird, then you should be familiar with a variety of film genres, for example, if you want to tell a story about a talented bird, then you should be familiar with a variety of film genres, for example, if you want to tell a story about a talented bird, then you should be familiar with a variety of film genres, for example, if you want to tell a story about a talented bird, then you should be familiar with a variety of film genres, for example, if you want to tell a story about a talented bird
If you want to make a romantic film, you should talk about the love between the young people and the waitresses in the small town.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your situation must not be out of the ordinary world.
(For example, Yan Zhen played that new Mo Tong Yang was burned, and then he could sing a role), then he could not go to open some cannons.
As far as the female lead is not weak-minded and shows some aspects in a certain way like a five-year-old child, I don't know why this is the reason or the requirement of the director.
There's one thing I don't understand, why he's so obsessed with adding car chases to his own movie?
This kind of film is arranged in the Spring holiday, and it is difficult to say that it is for the purpose of adding to the audience.

South African doctors: HIV transmission is strong, but many are HIV-free
Several South African doctors and medical practitioners believe that the new coronavirus mutant variant is more mild, although the spread rate is faster.
According to the U.S. Associated Press, as South Africa's five thousand doctors form a medical team to report, they currently treat new coronavirus cases with mild symptoms, such as body pain and cough.
Dr. Unben Pillay, a general practitioner, said that he sees a few dozen patients each day, but there are no patients who need to be hospitalized.
Prye said: "They can control the disease at home, most people recover within 10 to 14 days. "
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to be infected with the coronavirus.
He said, compared to the second wave of Delterta's epidemic, he treats new coronavirus patients "breathe difficulty, blood oxygen level is low.
Many people will stay in the hospital for a few days.
Two weeks after the first case of ebola in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it may take several weeks to collect enough data, physicians' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African Communicable Diseases Research Institute, only 30% of the severe cases, and the proportion of severe cases is only one-half of the previous epidemic. The average length of stay in hospital was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. Only 3% of the patients died, and the proportion of deaths was only 20% in the early epidemic.
The head of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, cited data from the country's infectious disease research institute and other reports to say: "Currently, all signs point to this being a mildly infectious disease.
He also said: "We still need to get late-stage data.
In most cases, the hospital and deaths occur later, and we enter this epidemic two weeks later. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalisations, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Despite Delta still remains the world's main new coronavirus, but the number of Ebola cases is increasing in several countries, including South Africa, which is the epicenter of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases increased by 400% in the first week of December, and the tests showed that the HIV-positive cases accounted for 90% or more.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education at the time: what is the way to save the children?
If the famous charity advertisement is like "no buying, no killing", then in the good environment, the group defense and the people's resistance, the crime will not occur in this kind of crime. In the good environment, the group defense and the people's resistance, the crime will not occur in this kind of crime.
Recently, the Public Security Bureau Investigation and Crime Prevention Bureau launched a child missing information urgent release platform.
This is a way to establish a missing child information dissemination channel, and the time to find back the kidnapped child.
The name of this app is "DuanDuan", which makes people feel warm.
The new technology techniques are not only named "art and culture", but also informationized.
The first priority is to find back the kidnapped children and protect their safety and freedom.
Secondly, it is the trial and punishment of the suspected person.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
But before the case is closed, attention should be paid to the safety of the victim.
The events are light and slow, and under the urgent "rescue" in the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue" of the "rescue"
Based on this type of case, people traffickers tend to leave the scene as soon as possible after they get their hands on the victims.
Within a minute, the child would be far away from his parents, and the difficulty of solving the case would increase.
In this situation, taking out the "roundtable" platform like this directly helps to solve the case and find back the child. It is a real action.
In the end, "dissolve" is a task that requires the whole legal system to do a good job.
Punish criminals, protect children and parents' rights, from legislative perfection, to judicial protection, and the secrecy of judicial protection, without any need of "protection of vulnerable".
In addition, pre-school children's prevention, from family to society, can be done better.
For example, a common case, a family of three, resting at a railway station, parents sleeping, waking up to find the child missing.
It is not possible to expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have enough self-protection awareness.
The father and mother both rest, or they will put the baby under the protection of the stable, which is the first way to prevent the baby from being pinched.
From the other side of the police's attack on trafficking criminals, the buying victims should also be payed attention and punished.
One individual's misconduct is just one link in a chain of misconduct.
According to China's Criminal Law, the minimum punishment for child abuse is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly severe, the punishment can be up to death, and confiscion of property.
The higher the punishment, the heavier the punishment, in the face of the trend of "light punishment", it is evident that the punishment is heavier than the crime.
Every year, there are still many cases of selling stolen goods.
It can be seen that some people have a view on raising children. The legal consciousness is shallow.
The part of people's law education should keep up with the pace.
To effectively control the sale of stolen property, it cannot rely solely on the government's strict enforcement.
If the market is broadly existent, the seller's greed will increase, and the seller will continuously innovate new ways of selling, and there will be a conflict between the seller and the law enforcer, which will result in a low effect.
As a result of this, breaking up the old-fashioned ideas, promoting legal knowledge, and helping to prevent crimes, child abuse, and buying and selling children.

The democratic peak has collapsed, and the democratic fire will never be extinguished.
The Summit for Democracy, led by U.S. President Donald Trump, with 110 countries' governments, civil society and private businesses led by their leaders, will conclude on Thursday (Dec. 10).
Biden said in closing remarks that freedom's flame burns in the hearts of every person, and totalitarianism will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said that he will hold the second session of the Global Democratic Summit next year.
Taiwan's government representative and cabinet member Tang Yao and Hong Kong's democratic activist Ro Gongqing also spoke at the forum on the second day.
Biden said: "We know how hard it is to stand in front of us."
But we also know that we can take on the challenge, because I have said in the past that the democratic world is everywhere.
The absolute power of tyranny will never be able to extinguish freedom's flame, it burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world.
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the whole society's collective effort.
He said: "As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen democratic governance, push reform, and realize transparency and accountability, as well as resisting the pressure of autocratic power, and those who seek power before nakedness and nakedness."
The second day's theme was to protect human rights, strengthen democracy and resist digital authoritarianism, and fight against digital authoritarianism and confirm the value of democracy.
This is the International Human Rights Day.
The Secretary General of the United Nations, Guterres, also expressed that democracy is facing challenges, especially the challenges brought by the new digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to emphasize common values and position, and democratic resilience.
This needs to deepen social dialogue, solve inequality problems, fight corruption, improve social dialogue, invest in quality education, and expand opportunities for women and children.
This also needs to be resolutely opposed to all forms of populism, nationalism and ultra-ism, including the use of technology revolutions to provide all tools. "
Hong Kong's democratic rights activators urged the participants to continue to pay attention to the situation of Hong Kong and Tibet and other ethnic minorities in China.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been subjected to China's rise, but it has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why political leaders and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use the resources we have to ensure the restoration of democracy is our first priority. "
Rohingaing also urged the world to unite against China's intimidation.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of the intimidation of the Communist Party, and maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market. Maybe some of you are not aware of (the Communist Party) threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
This is also the reason we need to change. "
Tang Yao, a member of the Executive Council of Taiwan's Executive Affairs Bureau, emphasized the value of democracy in his speech at the roundtable discussion on "Fighting Digital Totalitarianism" and stressed the importance of democracy.
He also shared how information transparency and building trust can combat the new coronavirus.
He said: "We have always stood firmly on the frontline of democracy against authoritarianism in Taiwan, and we will always play a leading role in promoting freedom, democracy and human rights in the world.
During the pandemic, governments around the world have used public health and collective interests as an excuse to rationalize violations of people's rights. Global democracy is showing signs of regression.
But in Taiwan, we don't have to shut down the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to close down to win the fake information. "
At the same time, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 companies accused of violating human rights in China, North Korea, and other countries.

For girls who are a little overweight, the choice of clothing and accessories is very important.
The girl's skirt should not be too short or too long, and the length should not be more than the knee. It should be able to cover the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on the thigh.
Too long will make people feel short and fat.
If you wear out the upper, middle and lower three sections, it will show that you are naturally higher, and the upper, skirt and long trousers are different colors. It will produce a sense of length.
Most dark-colored clothing is the standard for fat women, and dark color is also a good way to conceal your body fat. A black-colored short skirt is also the first choice for fat women.
Wearing a dark-colored outfit, especially a short skirt, will make you look a little slimmer.
If your thighs are very fat, your socks and shoes should not be worn too tight.
The more popular it is, the more colorful it should be.
When people pay attention to your thighs and feet, it makes you feel fat.
For girls who are a little bit fat, it is necessary to talk about dressing up.
Don't wear tight-fitting short skirts, and don't wear short skirts that are too short or stuffed in skirts, because it will make people feel uncomfortable. If your legs are fat, you should wear black-colored long skirt or net-grids skirt (the kind of net-grids skirt), and choose a quality soft and comfortable skirt, which can hide the fat girl.
Of course, thin girls wear short skirts, too.
Short skirts should be matched with short skirts of the same color. This way will make your fat figure look taller.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs look longer. This is the most IN this summer!
If you are overweight, but your legs are very thin, I recommend you to choose a skirt short skirt.
Not only can hide the big belly, but also can show your advantages.
Short skirts are very slim, and are suitable for thin girls. The dress should choose a tight one a little bit. It creates a layer-by-layer feeling.
A simple white T-shirt can also be paired with a short skirt. A fat person can also try it.
The slim girl is also able to wear fashionable clothes.
As long as she can grasp the rules of dressing up, thin girls will also be the focus of attention.
In terms of dressing up and matching, there have been changes, and in life, we should exercise more, so that we can get rid of the fat girl's label.

A girl aimed to shoot her sister: "I thought it was a good idea" - New Hua News
A girl stood on a large wooden board in front of the Huangzhou Wulin square. The wooden board was written with the words "meat and rabbit" and "ten yen one arrow".
Yesterday in the morning, a picture of "Hangzhou Girl Pengdang" for donation was released.
The photo shows a girl standing on a wooden plank that is slightly higher than a person's height, and the plank is inscribed with the words "meat lambs, 10 yen one arrow". It means that after paying the money, people can use the arrow to shoot.
This action has sparked controversy among netizens.
Yesterday, the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Sub-City Branch confirmed to the reporters that the police had confirmed that the girl had done this kind of action, but this kind of behavior was not worthy of applaud. After the girl had left the local police station, the girl had left the local police station.
Girl on the street "arrow target" donated to be reminded
In the picture, a long-haired girl stood in front of a large wooden board, the board was written with black ink on the board, the board was written with black ink on the board, she stood in front of another wooden board, another wooden board was written with silver bank account and QR code, etc.
The image sparked controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believe that this act is "a request for eye-balls" and some netizens express their sympathy.
We were on the morning of the 23rd at 10 o'clock when we saw the situation when we saw the crowd. At that time, the crowd was already many.
The two girls were aged between 20 and 24, and they were both dressed in their school uniforms.
One of the girls was crying, while the other girl was playing a game; another girl was crying, saying that her friend's sister had a bleeding disease, and now she needed surgical fees.
We were in contact with the local police in Guizhou, and we learned that the girl was being treated for leukemia.
Yesterday, the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau Sub-City Bureau announced to the Beijing News reporters that this girl is named Jiqi Li, who is the sister-in-law of Jiqi Li.
However, because treatment still needs to cost 30,000 yen, I couldn't think of a good way to donate, so I made this action.
He said that during the whole process, two girls were one targeted, one took the responsibility to shoot down, but there was no one to participate in the process, and there was no arrow shot during the whole process. Only pictures were taken and posted on the microblog.
After the police had determined that the arrows used were outside the scope of the law, the arrows used were outside the scope of the law.
The person in charge said, "We will not take this kind of eye-ball fundraising."
After being warned by the police, she has left the police station.

What was the hottest thing in 2021?
It is Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win medals?
A few weeks ago, an article about the project manager's impact on gold medals at the Olympic Games was very hot. In the article, the project managers were absolutely the first, no one can beat them: throwing stones, walking out, sleeping all night is the project manager's daily routine, and saving fire, cooking, and don't talk about it.
A seemingly playful article, however, also reveals the everyday struggles of project managers, and behind the scenes, represents the powerlessness of the current project management.
The people involved in the project management work also gradually choose some actions to get out of the dilemma of the work.
From the number of PMP (project management professional qualification) applicants, more and more project management professionals are improving their project management skills.
According to the China Project Management 20-Year Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, nearly 60,000 people have passed the PMP® exam, and about 42,000 people have passed the PMP® certification, and about 30,000 people have effective certificates, accounting for 31.2% of the total global PMP® certificates.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMPs holding certificates has increased year by year. This means that more and more project managers are realizing that the old experience is not enough to do the job. The ever-changing work environment makes us know that we need to learn how to adapt to change.
However, passing the PMP exam will ensure that project management is smooth and uninterrupted.
Many project management trainees expressed that by learning PMP/IPMP courses, they can systematically grasp the 10 major areas and five major processes of project management, but the actual project management work is still foggy.
Many project managers often provide feedback on the following issues: the project management knowledge is insufficient, only relies on personal experience, there is no project management theory, and does not know how to practice; there is a lack of systematic project management procedures, the work cannot fall into the ground, the project estimation cannot be accurate, and the control degree is insensitive, and the team members are not aware of the "old oil" in the team. The members are not clear of the division of labor, and the team's "old oil" is not known how to deal with ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
Because of this, for more than 10 years, he has helped many excellent companies to cultivate a large number of research and development managers, project managers, and so on, and received the "Chinese enterprise research and development management talent training demonstration base" and so on.
The project development training camp is an online course, which is a method of online fragmentation learning. It combines a lot of project development companies' cases, tools and methods, and helps you to grasp the project development manager's basic knowledge and standards, and walk on your own project management path.
This is also an opportunity to allow businesses to achieve lower costs and less investment, facilitate project managers' development, and provide businesses with opportunities to achieve high performance.
This course is not only conducted by a group of experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a group of experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, but also combined with international advanced project management theories and a lot of famous enterprise business scenarios.
It will also provide practical management tools and methods, as well as a wide variety of templates and checklists to help students to apply what they have learned to actual work.

The "Double 12" before the eve led consumers to rational consumption - Economic Observation Network - A professional financial news website
This year's "Double 11" online payment business transactions amount reached 1.77 trillion yen, which is higher than the previous year.
The variety of red envelopes, which attracts people's eyes, is broadcasted for the second time to make consumers feel the benefits, and this kind of consumption heat is another way to make the consumers feel the strength of the consumer's consumption power, and another way to make the consumers think about the influence of consumption on society and the contemporary mainstream consumers.
On the eve of "Double 12", Jucheng Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Jucheng Consumer Finance) issued a rational consumption guidance, reminded the young people to build good consumption habits and avoid blind consumption and over consumption.
According to the People's Bank released Consumer Credit Quality Survey Analysis Report, the Consumer Credit Quality Index was 66.81, which was 2.04 higher than 2019.
In general, our country residents' performance in financial consumption is good, but in terms of financial services and technology, there is a large difference in different aspects. It needs to further improve basic financial knowledge.
The elderly and young people's financial health is lower than each other, "one old one young" will still be the focus of financial education. Nielson's "Chinese Young People Debt Situation Report" and CNBC Financial's "2019-2020 Chinese Young People Consumption Report" shows that the young people have a huge potential of consumption, and the credit consumption has become the main driving force, and nearly half of the young people have no debt burden, and the young people have shown a rational consumption trend, but the young people's excessive consumption has caused social problems, and the financial institutions should take the responsibility to guide the young people.
As a card-issuing financial institution, Qixin has always strived to provide quality and caring services to help people build their own happy life, and advocate consumers to form good and correct consumption habits, and comply with supervisory requirements, so as to enhance consumers’ awareness of rational consumption.
Over the past few years, Jucheng has continuously targeted university students in the youth population with a variety of financial knowledge and activities, and through cooperation with the top universities in China, Jucheng has carried out a variety of forms of activities to guide the youth population's consumption needs in a reasonable manner, help them form a rational consumption view, reasonable regulation of consumption needs, and ultimately help them build up their rational consumption view, and help them build up their savings.
At the time of double-twelve, Qixin encourages all consumers and friends to establish reasonable consumption awareness and correct monetary view, prohibit blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption and over-consumption, avoid misguided consumption
During consumption, it is necessary to plan in advance and control the expenditure.
If you are late, late record will be recorded in the credit report, and it may affect your daily life, such as buying a car or buying a house.
At the same time, while enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose regulated institutions and channels, and pay attention to check the quality of the institutions concerned.
In the future, Qixin will continue to rely on its mature, reliable, and continuously updated financial products, and provide consumers with a variety of services that match their needs, help consumers continuously improve their knowledge of financial knowledge, and help consumers build up their rational consumption, and help consumers build up their financial knowledge, and provide consumers with a reliable financial companion.

Vietnamese people's newspaper - Haiphong Joint Committee
The Saudi King, Mohammad Bin Zedan, includes Aman, Alarab, Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait.
It's worth noting that this is the first time since the Saudi Arabia-Al Arab League and its allies embargoed Katair in 2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis since the Saudi Arabia-Al Arab League and its allies embargoed Katair.
During this crisis, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Palestine, and Egypt suspended their diplomatic relations with Qatar, and accused Qatar for supporting terrorist groups.
The diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal unity of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and has affected the economic production of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries blocked the route to the coastal airway.
This crisis was only resolved in January 2021 at the South China Sea Cooperation Association (SCISA) summit, where all South China Sea countries signed an agreement to resolve the dispute between the United States and the Republic of China.
Saat Alarab reopened the border with Katale.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The Gulf Arab countries seek to restore relations with Qatar, based on the interests and stability of each country and the region's stability, and must unite together in response to common challenges.
During this visit to Saudi Arabia, both sides agreed to open a direct land route between the two neighboring countries.
The 725-kilometer long connection between the two countries will provide convenience for the citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $50 billion in Amman, two companies signed a $30 billion joint venture agreement.

The countries of the Gulf have always viewed Iran as a long-term "rival" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a threat to the region's security.
The countries in the Gulf regard that it is necessary to solve the Iranian missile problem and to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
In the context of the various countries and Iran's desire to meet the expectations of the countries in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted a direct negotiation.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that affects the economic growth of China.
The upcoming G20 summit will be the first G20 meeting since some member countries and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have ended the G20 dispute.
This is the opportunity to re-assess the progress of the revitalization of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and at the same time put forward various measures, so that the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council can fully cooperate, in order to address the common challenges, in order to contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Good
Claimed to be the loudest in the new mountain area.
This time we brought this car, is many men's dream!
It's the Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement car model - Aventador LP700-4!
It cost two hundred thousand yen, a year's road tax costs ten thousand yen, four-wheeled traction, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horses, you can imagine how fast you can go.
I don't know either, data says acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h only takes 2.9 seconds, roughly it takes about 30 km/h for myvi to reach 100 km/h, huh.
The low-sized car body, the large knife door, and the large air intake under the car body all around, and the perfect interpretation of the 6.5 v12 engine, perfectly expresses the Fanbikini's style.
For car loans, there is no need to say too much, just Google it yourself, and the editor has summarized some Google explanations that are not given by Google.
Too much attention, go to where everyone is looking, it's too boring! (It's kind of boring).
1km of petrol costs RM1 to RM1 (the car owner doesn't care).
The posture of getting in and out of the car needs to be practiced, otherwise it will be a little uncomfortable (because it will be stuck in the seat after getting out of the car).
The engine sound is too loud, after stepping out of the car, the ears will be deafened. (It's still enjoyable).
The car is too big, parking in the common parking space will be too narrow, afraid to be hit by the car opening the door at the time!
I'm a bit bored, because there's no one to talk to (I'm talking about myself, and the driver has nothing to do with me).
Don't be fooled by this video's super run and don't buy it!
If you want to shoot a video of your beloved car, please contact us.

Let the academic spirit and the time spirit resonate with each other - New China
It is called the spirit of the great university, which refers to a series of academic ideas and values accumulated over a long period of development. It is the spirit of the great university.
From ancient times to the present, universities have played an important role in the development of politics, economy, culture, science and society.
From the birth of the first modern university in the world, the university is burdened with a unique mission that is different from other social organizations, and for the Chinese university, the birth of the nation’s crisis in autumn, its spirit is deeply affected by the traditional culture and the changes of the times, and it promotes the concept of “education for the benefit of the world” and “education for the benefit of the country”.
At present, higher education informationization and internationalization trends are increasingly apparent, and the global scope of education competitions, technology competitions, and talent competitions are continuously intensified. Higher education is an important "supply-side" and structural reform is facing the unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the overall plan for the construction of world-class universities and world-class disciplines, demonstrates the confidence and determination of China's transition from a high-level education to a high-level education. At the same time, it also raises the requirements of universities' development.
How to speed up the construction of world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines in a certain period of time, on the basis of a certain gap, accelerate the construction of world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines?
Besides the target self-confidence, path self-confidence, and ability self-confidence, the university should also have three advantages: the first is the cultural self-confidence, the second is the cultural self-confidence, and the third is the institutional self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the institutional self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self-confidence, the cultural self
It is important to realize that building world-class universities cannot be monolithic, and each school must display its own strength and characteristics.
The school’s characteristics should have both Chinese characteristics and also show the unique characteristics of targeted position, traditions and resources.
With regard to Zhejiang University, we focus on three aspects: the first is to highlight innovation and entrepreneurship, to build a comprehensive system of innovation and entrepreneurship, to build a comprehensive system of innovation and entrepreneurship, and to build a comprehensive system of innovation and entrepreneurship. The second is to highlight the academic disciplines and social services, to promote the academic disciplines and social services, and to build a comprehensive system of academic disciplines and social services. The third is to highlight the academic disciplines and social services, to promote the academic disciplines and social services, and to build a comprehensive system of academic disciplines and social services.
In this process, the most important thing is to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university and the time spirit resonate with each other.
For Zhejiang University, "Seeking Innovation" is the school motto, "Studying, Cultivating, Making, Discovering, and Realizing" are the common values of Zhejiang University.
This is the school's firm adherence to the correct direction of education, and the continuous accumulation of cultural high-degree, and the consolidation of spiritual power, which is an important guarantee.
Among them, "Hainan River" emphasizes the openness and inclusiveness of the spirit, and expresses the idea of "the world is used by me" as well as "the true and good spirit". "The true and good spirit" emphasizes the pursuit of the true and good spirit, and expresses the idea of "the world is used by me" as well as "the true and good spirit". "The tree spirit of the country" emphasizes the reform and innovation of the spirit, and expresses the idea of "the tree spirit of the country". "The tree spirit of the country" emphasizes the reform and innovation of the spirit, and expresses the idea of "the tree spirit of the country". "The tree spirit of the country" emphases the reform and innovation of the spirit, and expresses the idea of "the tree spirit of the country". "The tree spirit of the country" emphases the reform and innovation of the spirit, and expresses the idea of "the tree spirit of the country". "The tree spirit of the country" emphases the reform and innovation of the spirit, and expresses the idea of "the tree spirit of the country".
This series of spiritual ideas and values pursuits is the essence of the spirit of the University of Zhejiang for 120 years.
A wise person listens to no sound, a clear-sighted person sees what is not formed.
China's universities should step up to the stage of Chinese socialism, deeply grasp the time position and historical mission of the university, and build a world-class university.
At the same time, adhering to humanism and independent freedom, make the university spirit and time spirit and national spirit mutually stimulate each other, so as to realize the realization of the country's prosperity and national revival, and realize the realization of human's common ideal.

The size of the track is the size of the market, the length of the track is the stage of the industry, the length of the track is the competition of the industry.

Three U.S. universities accused of discriminating against Chinese students - New China
On the 3rd day of May 2020, the Chinese Education Association submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice against 30 U.S. universities that discriminated against Asian students.
The Chinese-American Educational Alliance held a press conference on the day.
The head of the group said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Chinese applicants who meet the U.S. university admission criteria has increased, but in these three U.S. universities, the proportion of Chinese applicants remains stable.
A number of studies have shown that these universities are engaged in a long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian students.
Wu Yuzhou explained that the researchers from 2014 to 2014 showed that in these three universities, the admission rate of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
The U.S. Department of Education's data also shows that at every Ivy League school, Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest percentage of Asian students. Yale University and Brown University implemented a racial quota of 20 years or more.
Wu Yao told Xinhua News reporters that they hoped to submit a complaint after the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice would be able to carry out an investigation and take action to stop these universities from recruiting students based on racial discrimination.
They also hope that the universities will be able to change the recruitment policy for Asians.
So far, the three schools have not responded to the complaints.
The Asian Educational Alliance was founded in 1915, when the University of Hawaii was accused of discriminating against Asians. However, the United States Education Department did not accept the complaint.
This time, in addition to the United States Chinese-American Association, the Indian-American Association, the Japanese-American Association, the Filipino-American Association, and the Pakistani-American Education Association.

In September 2020, Li Xian Sheng learned about a factory house located in the township of Luo Xiao in Yuzhou, after visiting the house several times, Li Xian Sheng decided to buy the factory house.
In December 2012, Liu Xinshi bought a factory building with the details of the owner of the house and his family members. After negotiating with the owner of the house, he paid the deposit of 20,000 yuan in December 2012.
The buyer wrote his signature on the "Factory Buy and Sell Agreement", which stated that "if the buyer doesn't want to buy the factory, the seller will return the deposit to the buyer, and if the buyer doesn't want to buy the factory, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, and both parties agreed to sign the factory buy and sell agreement within one week.
However, after the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the scope of the factory buildings and the payment terms, the delay in the signing of the real estate purchase contract was due to the fact that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the scope of the factory buildings and the payment terms.
Thinking about the fact that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the content of the agreement, a few days later, Linn was to return the 20,000 yen deposit back to the first defendant.
The house was easy to see, and the money was paid, the money was ready, but the seller didn't sell, and this made the first buyer frustrated.
For this reason, Li Xinsheng filed a lawsuit to the People's Court of Yiyang City.
The court concluded that the parties did not sign a formal contract, so the defendant did not have to bear the double damages. The defendant did not have to bear the double damages.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the Second Appeals Court upheld the original verdict.
The lawyer warns that in the transaction process, you should pay attention to the necessary obligations.
At the time of signing a contract, the buyer should pay attention to the obligations of the seller, such as checking the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied by people, and so on. The contract should also specify the time and place of the delivery of the house. To avoid disputes between the parties at the time of signing the contract.
After the end of the "Democratic Summit", the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhou Xi (Dec. 12, 2021) said that the United States held the "Democratic Summit" is "an ideological form, to make the democratic tools, the democratic tools, the democratic name, the democratic realities, the democratic opposition, the democratic division, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the democratic weapons, the dem
The Chinese government believes that "long-term, the United States will use its own political system and values to impose on the people, advocate "democratic reform", instigate "color revolution", cause disastrous consequences.
The "democracy" has already become the "large-scale destructive weapon" of the United States' intervention in another country.
This summit is a showcase of Biden's campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was conducted via video conferencing, with 111 countries' leaders invited to attend, including Taiwan's leader, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for not having the right to hold the summit, saying that the United States had no right to hold the summit.
Internationally and in the United States, there are doubts about the quality of sound, for example, some of the leaders of authoritarian regimes, such as Philippine, Poland, and Brazil, have been invited to attend the summit, and there are people who are suspicious about the true intentions of the government, for example, Philippine, Poland, and Brazil.
The newly appointed German Chancellor, Fuch Scholz, also attended the video meeting of the World Democratic Summit.
China's Foreign Affairs Department's official statement said that "Today's U.S. democracy is increasingly polarized, money politics, identity politics, political polarization, political extremism, social cleavage, ethnic antagonism, and poverty inequality, etc. problems are increasingly severe." The U.S. democracy is based on the capitalistic basis.
As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen democracy, to push reform, and to realize transparency, to protect against tyranny, and to resist against tyranny, and those who seek power before nakedness and naked power.
He stressed that democracy is not inherently democratic, "we need to update it every generation," he said. "I think this is our generation's challenge."
Biden also said that democracy and human rights "face continuing challenges and threats" and democracy needs to be defended.
The United States has pledged to carry out a year-long action, including a USD4.244 billion proposal, to strengthen democracy worldwide and support independent media outlets.
The U.S. wants all countries to make a commitment to hold a summit on democracy in 2022 by the end of next year, and make a specific public commitment to improve its democratic system.
Biden said, "Let's make good on our promises and report on our progress next year."
I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.

In the university campus, students come from five lakes and four seas, their abilities are different, and their learning levels are different, and the learning situation is different.
For a group with so many different characteristics, it is difficult to assess. There are different feelings, and it is difficult to avoid.
Of course, if the test questions are of the same type, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, there will be a different feeling.
Students who don't use their brains, may be able to pass the central exam, but if they want to try other ways, they can achieve the effect of 2.5 times.
If this is the case, there will be "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not participate, and even get high scores; "students" who do not

Oil pipeline video begins bottom military 20 years ago - Xinhua.net
The source of the video (oil pipe).
On December 11, the oil pipeline platform released a micro film called "Killer Machine" attracted widespread attention.
The film depicts the U.S. using "anti-terrorism" as an excuse to wage a war in Afghanistan, through which the U.S. will impose the U.S. style of democracy on Afghanistan, 20 years of poverty, corruption, and bloodshed, and commit a variety of crimes against humanity.
Use drones to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian areas, twist human nature, and form a killing group.
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed thousands of Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set "black sites" against "suspects" to impose torture and humiliation.
One village after another, the actions of human beings are causing more and more Afghans to hate the Afghans.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorism" war is "more anti-terrorism" than "anti-terrorism".
The war has not brought the Afghan people any hope of peace and prosperity, and the only thing it has brought is a multitude of countries and a multitude of destruction.
We will expose the truth about the U.S.'s "anti-terrorism" under the guise of "anti-terrorism," reveal the truth about the U.S.'s bloody slaughter, and expose the false face of the U.S.'s democracy!
I happened to see this article, from the perspective of the business and the preservation period, discussing why the customer wants to do this in the container warehouse, although the container packing belongs to the deep packing, but it does not belong to the preservation period of the container warehouse, this article may be able to explain why the customer wants to do this.
I visit a lot of dairy factories, and touch a lot of dairy production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the milk powder and the milk powder are the same, there is no difference.
So naturally everyone will ask: Why is the bag's warranty period one year, while the hearing's warranty period is two years or longer?
Or ask: Why is the price difference so large?
From this point on, many consumers, or grandmothers, believe that this is because the raw materials are different, and the quality is better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, just that people think that expensive is good.
There are also consumers out of this mindset who ate it and then said that the taste or flavor was not the same!
Now, I'll tell you the reason for the price. Where is the price?
They are made of the same raw materials, and the price is as high as this.
Most factories consider that if the price is too high, consumers are hard to accept, which means that the profit is low, or even no profit. How do factories survive?
As a result, they're priced up to a very large margin to protect their profit space.
Most factories are promoting bags, not pouches.
There are so many factories every year's advertising fees, how much can be a few hundred million or even several billion, where do the fees come from?
Everyone can think of it.
With the development of society and market promotion fees, such as advertising personnel, shelves display fees, product gift fees, advertising fees, etc. are also increasing continuously.
Therefore, each manufacturer is constantly increasing new products, and the price is also rising, and the cost is also increasing, which is due to the increase of the market price.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, and their raw materials will increase the cost of up to 3 or 4 yen.
There is also a part of brands, for the purpose of promoting their own products, they do not choose any means, with the help of doctors and doctors, from them assisting the promotion of the products, from RMB 30 to RMB 80.
China's relevant laws prohibit this kind of operation method. In fact, this kind of operation is harmful to consumers.
Recommend everyone to buy a bag of milk powder and put it into the jar, so that it can save the cost and increase the storage and sealability, and it will not have any impact on the baby.
There is also no need to think that the quality period of the hearing pack is the same as that of the bag pack. If the hearing pack is opened after the bag pack, the quality period of the hearing pack is the same as that of the bag pack. It is easy to change the quality of the hearing pack after the bag pack.

Don't throw people down on the starting line - New China
During the book fair, you can feel the heat of the success books.
Today's successful books are full of "best practices" - i.e., they tell you what you should do, and then tell you what you should do.
It's like saying "how to do it" is the most important, most basic issue.
Because of this, these books all have a common characteristic - they are either going to be the best, or they are going to be the worst; they are either going to be 100, or they are going to be zero; they are either going to climb to the top of the mountain, or they are going to climb to the bottom of the mountain.
This "best principle" allows anyone to acknowledge "right on the spot," but 99% of people will be knocked out by the starting line.
This theory is based on a "you need to make a 180-degree change in your life" path, and this is the fate of many people.
For those who adhere to the old rules, and those who do not want to change, you should say to them, "you should change". It is a kind of bullying and bullying people.
Most people will show up with "change" at the front of the two words, and hesitate to make a decision; or else, with the impulse of the change of the decision, they will leave out the first step, but, after a while, they will fail to continue the change of the decision, and they will not be able to continue the change of the decision for a long time, and they will not be able to see the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of the change of
Masengli's famous book "From Tomorrow", which is the classic of "universal human nature", is the classic of this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem of the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, so most people "want to see a miracle".
Perhaps, "the next good principle" is a way to make more ordinary people walk on the path of success.
The core of "next best" is about "decrease barriers" - it is a theory that encourages a kind of "small victory over big victory". If you do not reach 100, only do 1: because 1 is always bigger than 0; if you do not climb up to Taishan, only climb up to your own doorstep's small sandy beach, too.
In general, as long as you do something, it will always be better than not doing anything.
Because the threshold has been lowered, so more ordinary people are able to keep up with the pace, and the success rate will be increased.
Following the successful path, its path length is slightly longer.
In summary, "the best principle" may seem to make everyone successful, but in fact, it can only excite a few; and "the second best principle" can excite more people.

Blue Sea Lake fish resources increase by 0.71 tons - New China
Xinhua News December 11th (reporter Li Xiao Fei, Zhang Hongxiong) reporter from Qinghai Province Agriculture and Rural Villages Department learned that the latest monitoring results showed that the Quhai Lake fish resources stock was increased by 0.71 thousand tons, reaching 10.85 thousand tons, exceeding the 2002 year protection period by 40 times.
The green sea lake is a common fish species, called "water-fish", which is a rare fish species in the green sea lake. It plays an important role in the ecological safety and biological diversity of the green sea lake, and has a great impact on the ecological safety and biological diversity of the green sea lake.
In the 60s of the 20th century, due to the large-scale fishing, breeding and reproduction of the aquatic environment, the green lake fish population decreased, and in 2002, the green lake fish resources were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Chinese Species Red List listed the Green Sea Shark as an endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai province implemented a ban on fishing in the lake, prohibiting any organization, group, or individual to fish in the lake and its tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of fish and their products.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and discharge, as well as cleaning up the Blue Sea Lake's major tributaries, and designing scientific and reasonable "fishway" and other measures, the Blue Sea Lake's fish resources will increase year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy governor of Qinghai Agriculture and Rural Villages, said that as of now, Qinghai Lake has raised nearly 1.8 billion fish, and the contribution of fishery resources has exceeded 23%.
The Three Rivers of Qinghai is our country's most important ecological barrier and water source, and Qinghai Lake is the natural barrier and ecological function area.
To protect the ecosystem of the Three River Basin and the Qinghai Lake water area and protect the water fauna, protect the water fauna of the Qinghai Highland, since this year, the Three Rivers, the Yellow River, and the Qinghai Lake have issued a ban on fishing in the Three Rivers, the Yellow River, and the Qinghai Lake. A comprehensive fishing ban management system has been established.

The restaurant only gave me a bag, and I had to put it into the bag, and the weather was cold.
I want to ask a question, is the bag put in a bag or not?
We only saw one bag.
I wanted to know if it was a leak or we took it away, thanks.
It's already 1 hour, and still hasn't sent.
I just saw a piece of a fake article. It was too long.
Tell men who don't know anything about male circumcision.
Most girls experience their first period between the age of 13 to 15, and it usually occurs between the age of 50.
After the body is healthy, it will be compared to the law every month once a month.
But that doesn't mean that you can accurately predict, within a week or so, you need to prepare ahead of time, sometimes the weather will change (suddenly ahead of time).
Time duration, blood volume, pain degree varies from person to person. Some people take three days, some people take a week; some people have little blood loss, some people have a lot of blood loss; some people have no reaction, some people have pain until they are rescued, pain will change with time. Previously, pain does not mean that the next generation will be painless.
When the menstruation cannot be controlled, it starts to end to stop for a few days, 24 hours of bleeding can be done only by using sanitary napkins or sanitary napkins.
The pain mainly is due to the secretion of the anterior loin, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as soon as the pain comes, and the pain is relieved as
During the pre-menstrual period, because the uterus is filled with blood and the pre-ovulatory hormone is released, it is easy to swell the belly.
If it takes about a week, the pregnant woman will give birth to a baby. In general, the pregnant woman will give birth to a baby in about two days.
It is best to change the sanitary napkin every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, and if you sleep at night, the worst case is to change 6 times in a day, every month, it is 42 pieces, and if you prepare in advance, it can be 50 pieces.
This place needs to be changed once in a while, and the health cotton bar does not need to be changed frequently, and the longest eight hours can be changed once in eight hours.
The menstrual period may be irregular, and the premenstrual period may also be affected by hormonal changes in the body. The irregularity of the menstrual period and the premenstrual period may affect the body.
However, official data can show that women's control of emotions is very high, and it is not easy to find emotional problems.
The blood isn't just blood, it includes shedding of the uterine membranes.
After the end of the uterine membrane, the thickness of the uterine membrane is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens, and it can be understood that the uterine is a house, and every month builds a house (the uterine membrane thickens), and it is ready to receive guests, but the guests do not come, and the whole month takes off the uterine membrane, and the next month builds a new uterine membrane, and every month repeats.
The menstruation is very inconvenient, continuously for several years, every month for several days, 24 hours of blood flowing, still will be abdominal pain, who wants to?
But a person can come into the world because of his mother's pregnancy, pregnancy is for the purpose of preparing you to live in a house for 10 months. People should thank their mother for her healthy pregnancy.
In the past, women's many things were suppressed, society gave women a brain washing that it was dirty, shameful, but now it has changed.
If someone feels pregnancy disgusting, feels the woman's body as preparation for pregnancy, don't say anything about it in the crowd below, the girls stand up, don't forget to experience, and this child won't experience, and the men won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are, and they won't know how good they are,
Finally, the sisters tried the hygiene towel. It was really good.

Washing the feet and bathing the feet is not leaking electricity, isn't it?
Choose an appropriate foot bath basin can achieve good foot therapy, and today, the author will discuss this issue. The author will discuss this issue.
As people's awareness of health is strengthened, the bath spa basins are increasingly attracted by consumers, and a variety of products appear in the market, from RMB100 to RMB1,000 bath spa basins, giving consumers a large choice space.
On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of bath tubs and other health appliances are booming, but bath tubs and other health appliances do not have a special industry standard, so there are some safety risks.
Walking in water with electricity is really dangerous!
Mr Li told the reporter that he bought a foot bath basin for his father-in-law as a gift for his father-in-law's birthday, but his father-in-law felt foot pain.
Mr. Li began by thinking that the vibrating function was caused by the vibrating function, but he didn't think that the vibrating function was caused by the vibrating function, and his father-in-law felt the pain in his feet.
Mr. Li used an electric pen, and the electric pen lit up, Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the bathtub contained electricity.
Afterwards, he contacted the businessmen, and the attitude of the businessmen was still satisfactory, although he gave up the bathtub, Li Xingsheng still felt uncomfortable.
Because he discovered this long-standing bathtub, which is now set at the highest temperature, is suitable for all kinds of people, all kinds of materials, and ensures no harm in all aspects.
But in most cases, a shower basin will not have any electrical problems, but there are some products that come out of the factory without strict quality control.
Therefore, when you are buying a foot bath, choose a split-type foot bath.
Water and electricity are separated, there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take a pencil to measure.

Aid money is often not able to be sent to six four easily.
In 1994, under the advice of Tianan Mother, a special committee was established by "Tianan Mother" to collect and distribute donations.
In 1998, MCDF established the Six-Four Orphans Education Fund, which ran for 11 years, and in 2009, after all Six-Four Orphans had graduated from their universities, MCDF established the Six-Four Orphans Poverty Relief Fund, and it has been running ever since.
These projects' funding comes from the school's endowment and social donations, as well as personal donations.
Since 2018, they have also received support from the Labour Reform Research Fund.
Until last year, it took 31 years to receive a portion of Hong Kong's donations to the Six-Four Fund in the name of the Six-Four Fund.

If you want to enter the industry, you can choose a place to train, but if you don't have this idea, the best way is to self-study, because the cost of training is very expensive, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is a good choice, especially for those who are weak and self-producers, training is a good choice.
If you are strong enough, you can choose to self-study, but it is too exhausting.
Choosing a good training institute is very important.
First, look at this organization's teachers' strength, if the teachers' strength is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some new opening training institutions' teachers' strength is not very strong.
The second thing is to choose a training institute before investigating this training institute. The best way is to investigate this training institute's students, because only the training institute's students know how the training institute is good or bad.
Hello, I don't know how to answer your question, because I don't know about your situation and I don't know how to answer your question.
For example, professional, age, and the language you want to learn, these will all be related to the place you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and still haven't graduated, or if you are a computer major who has already graduated, then I recommend you to self-study. This is the lowest efficiency and lowest cost. There are many online and offline tutoring institutions, but the cost is high and the time is long.
However, if I say these conditions, it is very easy to study. There are many free resources on the Internet, and most of the training resources are free. If you don't want to find resources, you can also contact me and get free resources. If you don't want to find resources, you can also contact me and get free resources.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with video and multimedia learning.
If you are not a computer specialist, but you can also pay a certain amount of tuition fees and time fees, then I recommend you to go to a vocational institute to learn, because this way of learning is not very expensive, and the teachers are very detailed, and there are also people who can answer your questions. Besides, in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition fees and time fees, and in the tuition
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, with a salary, and students will be recommended to companies. This way, after the job interview, they will be able to find a job.
The above is my view of some things, and I don't understand your situation, so I can only give a brief introduction. If you have any other questions, you can contact me to communicate with me.
I said 1 point earlier, I saw the App on the App

However, right-wing has played a significant role in the social progress.
From the end of the definition of the truth, development of economy, technology, and other aspects, right-wing's ultimate significance should not be denied.
Three, from my point of view, although I don't agree with Li Wei Dong's views, but I do respect him. He is sincere, and he is sincere about China. He is sincere about China's social problems.
But I'm against his anti-communist theory, I believe that revolution is necessary, and revolution necessarily leads to social turmoil, people's lives will be affected, political groups will be chaotic, and foreign countries will invade.
Four, change or improve the attitude of China to be patient and bear the responsibility of the country for the people, that is not right-wing, but mixed-up.
Talk some more.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of time and politics.
If you say that right has a significant impact on society, the Communist Party will listen to some right's opinions and analysis of their thoughts at the right time, but the left will not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have this effect, because the left does not have
5. Recently, I saw that some friends were bullying each other, and they were very aggressive, I felt that it was not necessary.
Don't try to talk reason, it's just a string, there's no reason to talk.
And don't try to prove that we're right, and don't try to think that we're right, what's the point?
I'm telling my friends: when you're being bullied for five yen, when you're being bullied for your right dog's time, it's a clear sign that we're on the right path!
Many people when they were young had dreams, but as they grew older, they forgot their dreams, or they pursued their dreams.
And the ideal is getting farther and farther, until the young dragon finally becomes an evil dragon.
I feel that there is a balance between constraint and freedom, and China's history and culture should be based on the first ancestors.
The right-wing focuses on efficiency and development, while the left-wing focuses on supervision and strengthening. The right-wing focuses on efficiency and development, while the left-wing focuses on supervision and strengthening.
The society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, the competition between China and the United States is still definite, and it is expected to continue for a long time.
Even though I don't understand, I'll give a thumbs up.
I don't want to say anything, the flowers are just like this.
Over the past two years, the U.S. against China's semiconductor's embargo and blockade has not only made China's semiconductor fall into a situation that it has never experienced before, but also made "U.S. companies" suffer great losses.
The United States pressures China's semiconductor industry, requiring its own companies and alliance countries to simultaneously block China's semiconductor industry, directly resulting in a shortage of semiconductor supply, resulting in a decrease in semiconductor manufacturing investment and profits, causing a decrease in semiconductor manufacturing companies' research and development investment, resulting in a shortage of semiconductor supply chain. As a result, the semiconductor manufacturing industry's research and development investment decreases, resulting in a decrease in semiconductor manufacturing companies' production capacity, resulting in a decrease in semiconductor supply chain.
Today, the shortage of semiconductors has affected all major industries, including automobile manufacturers, mobile phone price hikes, and almost all semiconductor related industries have been affected.
For the purpose of gaining control over the microchip, more and more countries have started to follow the path of "de-Americanization".
For the purpose of controlling global semiconductor control, the U.S. has been acting frequently, and the U.S. has also invited 64 countries to form a semiconductor alliance, and invited the U.S. large semiconductor technology companies, such as Intel, to repurchase the semiconductor technology of the U.S. from the U.S., such as the U.S. large semiconductor technology companies, such as Intel, to repurchase the semiconductor technology of the U.S., such as the U.S. large semiconductor technology companies, such as Intel, to repurchase the semiconductor technology of the U.S., such as the U.S. large semiconductor technology companies, such as Intel, to repurchase the semiconductor technology of the U.S., such as the U.S. large semiconductor technology companies, such as Intel, to repurchase the semiconductor technology of the U.S., such as the U.S. large semiconductor technology companies, such as Intel, to repurchase the semiconductor technology of the U.S.,
Most people believe that this action will cause a certain impact on Taiwan's semiconductor industry, and there is a possibility that it will steal away Taiwan's semiconductor industry's "dinner plate".
The reason why it is so confident, is because Intel, as the world's largest semiconductor technology giant, has been engaged in the semiconductor field for more than 20 years, and has a large number of talents and technical reserves. It must be able to quickly rise up in a short period of time, and defeat the Taiwan semiconductor.
However, for Intel's decision, Zhang Zhuo, the founder of Taixin Dian, did not care.
At this year's April's "2021 Teacher's Think Tank", Zhang Zhongyu said that Intel's chip manufacturing plant is very worrying, and he said that Intel's chip manufacturing plant is very worrying.
Zhang Zhongyu's reason for opposing Intel's entry into the semiconductor industry is because Zhang Zhongyu's 30 years ago he had a grudge against Intel and Intel's grudge against Zhang Zhongyu is because Zhang Zhongyu's grudge against Intel and Intel's grudge against Zhang Zhongyu is because Zhang Zhongyu's grudge against Intel and Intel's grudge against Zhang Zhongyu is because Zhang Zhongyu's grudge against Intel and Intel's grudge against Zhang Zhongyu is because Zhang Zhongyu's grudge against Intel and Intel's grudge against Zhang Zhongyu is because Zhang Zhongyu's grudge against Intel and Intel's grudge against Zhang Zhongyu is because Zhang Zhongyu's grudge against Intel and Intel's grudge against Zhang Zhongyu is because Zhang Zhongyu's grudge against Intel and Intel's grudge against Zhang Zhongyu is because Zhang Zhongyu'
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the world's leading semiconductor manufacturer, the world's leading semiconductor manufacturer, and the world's leading semiconductor manufacturer.
In the 1980s, the world's top semiconductor chips were always in the hands of a few strongholders.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was based on the IDM model, and the chip from design, manufacturing to testing was completed by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this kind of model makes some small enterprises unable to bear the burden, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face the huge capital expenditure.
In response to market demand, after entering the 80s, the chip industry began to exhibit a division of labor cooperation phenomenon. In 1984, Zhang Zhongpei said that there was a company specially doing chip design, so it could establish a company specially for manufacturing semiconductors. Therefore, it was possible to establish a factory specially for manufacturing semiconductors.
Not long after, Zhang Zhong's design turned into reality, the Taiwan accumulated electric was born.
TaiSunDian mainly focuses on "Laser Cutting", which is only one circle, without design, only provides Laser Cutting service.
At the time when the Taiwanese was founded, the Intel was a giant monster in front of the Intel.
To obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongyu looked for Intel to invest, but at that time, Intel seemed to hear that Taiwan Semiconductor was only doing chip manufacturing, and it seemed to be somewhat self-important, and did not see Taiwan Semiconductor.
Zhang Zhongyu also believes that Intel at that time did not pay attention to the crystal manufacturing service.
It didn't think that at that time the crystal manufacturing service was the big head, but now it is also starting to do crystal manufacturing service.
So, Zhang Zhongyu realized that Intel entered the semiconductor manufacturing industry.
Tesla's market value has already surpassed Intel.
In the face of Taiwan's strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to step back.
TaiSic's 3nm chip has already surpass Intel's 7-year-old 14nm.

At the beginning, my friend introduced the reason of trust, so I chose to look at the initial calculation of 70,000 basic decoration.
When you get to the store, you start a series of tricks.
I was the first time to go to the store and just looked at my floor plan, but they didn't go to the site to measure the house, and they were able to give me a quote based on my 135 square meters at 70,000, which was able to make a deal. The rough estimate of their materials was not known.
Their second scam is that you just have to go to the store and they will drag you into a contract (and the money you get is never going to be refunded, unless you have enough experience and they will negotiate with you).
When you are in doubt about whether to pay a deposit or not, they will invite their manager to tell you that they will give you a discount.
This is a big hole, I was fooled by this example, I paid a thousand dollars.
He gave me an estimate of $70,000, which did not include water and electric upgrades, and did not include any doors and cabinets, but these three items were the major cost.
Apart from these, their service fees are higher than those of other companies.
I lost my trust in this company, and I didn't know what was going to happen until I signed the contract.
When I went to collect money from them, they showed a very experienced look, with a special small group to pay you.
Whatever the case may be, they will always blame the customer for the problem.
All kinds of pressure, there are a lot of details, I don't want to say them all, but I don't want to choose them, because my friends found them to renovate their houses, but the quality is not good.
They're just pretending to be the dragon's head decoration, but now they've changed it into something else.
So, don't choose this way of decoration company.
Later, when you are choosing, look at these, and check these out.
If you want to ask the merchant, you need to log in or register.
Strictly prohibit the release of all kinds of rating of merchants, detailedly see merchants record
Provide you with the latest information about the address, phone, business hours and other information of the businesses, find the decoration company and decoration company.
This is so scary, within 30 minutes cancel the order!
Is there no other way? Like, changing the address?
It's good, if you don't cancel this conversation, if you don't get my money within 5 to 10 days, I will pursue you.
I asked for 15 minutes not to be canceled.

The sky is full of double stars, and the rain of the 14th day of the new moon.
Tianxin News, December 12th, 2020 (reporter Zhou Yuanjing) Astronomer explains that the last large scale meteor shower of the year will come on December 14th. The double star shower will come on December 14th, which is the last large scale meteor shower of the year. The meteor lovers can observe the meteor shower on the night of December 14th.
A double star rain in the sky in Beijing on December 13, 2018.
Most of the parent bodies of comets are sporadic comets, but the parent bodies of two-sided comets are two-sided comets, which is a two-sided comet.
The twin star rain is also the second known not to be the pregnancy of the twin star rain.
The Tianjin Astronomical Society's Director and Astronomy Expert, Tianmin Xutong, said that the comet would appear at the end of the year, and "the comet period" can last from December 4th to December 17th.
The rainfall is large and stable, and it is referred to as one of the three major rainfalls in the Northern Hemisphere.
The prominent feature of the dual-star rain show is that the speed of the flowing stars is slow, the colors are rich, and the fire-flowing stars are not few. It is suitable for beginners to observe, and also suitable for amateur astronomers to photograph.
The Tianjin astronomer Yang Yi took photos of the twin star rain on December 13, 2020 in Tianjin Tiezhou.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's twin star rain will arrive at December 14th at 15:00-16:00, and the large rain will arrive at December 14th at 15:00-16:00, and the large rain number will be 150.

Last year, the twin star rain shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's twin star rain shower will be affected by the moon light interference, but the brightness of the twin star rain shower will be reduced.
On the 14th of the 11th month of the 11th month, the moon was bright, and the bright moon light would interfere with the observation. The bright moon light would fall down at this time.

Friends who like the rain of stars can observe the sky after sunset, but beware of cold and warm.
How can we see more of the comets?
You can choose a place with a high altitude and a good view in the city or in the suburbs, and then wait for the moon to fall down. After the moon falls down, you can look at the sky.
Attention should be paid to the fact that the rainfall in all directions of the twin star rain is very large, and it is not necessary to watch the twin star rain rainfall directly.
Friends who like photography will want to take pictures of a starry rain, and the best choice is a wide lens and a large aperture. When you take pictures, use high ISO and the largest aperture.
Based on stability and continuity, three-legged platform, backup battery and fasten line are also not to be missed.

What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in the market position?
According to my understanding, the traditional television should be the liquid crystal television, and the high-definition television and the liquid crystal television in the market position are basically different. There are mainly two points:
The first is that the laser TV is more concentrated on the big screen market.
Compared with liquid crystal TV, the market position of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the market of the
At present, the main liquid crystal TV screen size is between 55 inches to 65 inches, while the LED TV's screen size is generally above 75 inches, and the maximum is over 100 inches. Fully meet the user's demand for large screen TV.
In recent years, the sales volume and sales volume of large-screen LED TV has increased, and the proportion of the total sales volume of large-screen LED TV exceeds more than 60%.
According to the forecast of Zhongyang Kong, the market sales of laser TV will increase by more than 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain high growth.
The reason for the good performance in the big screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of the laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the principle of reflected image, the light source emitted by the laser source does not directly enter the eyeball, compared to the back light source of liquid crystal television, the image process is closer to the natural conditions, and the irritation produced by the eye ball is smaller.
The China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute, the Western Institute and the Beijing Hospital Ophthalmologists, carried out a strict comparison test under the same conditions, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
The data confirms that the laser TV has a very strong protective eye property, and in a certain aspect has a certain improvement effect.
With the increasing attention given to eye health, LED TV has not only attracted more users, but also opened up a new market in the LED market.
The second is that the laser TV will focus on the high-end market.
The price of liquid crystal televisions continues to drop, and the current price of liquid crystal televisions is generally above 10,000 yuan. With the increase of screen size and light source, the price continues to rise.
What is the price of this laser TV?
It's definitely reasonable.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, the liquid crystal television and projector cannot achieve the superiority of the liquid crystal television and projector.
Thanks to ultra-short distance projection technology, LED TV's projection distance is comparable to traditional projection devices, and can achieve 100 inch large screen experience within a short distance, while the space required is small, and the device is small.
In terms of brightness, large-screen LED TVs can reach 2000 or more of brightness.
The heat generation is lower, the device consumption is less, and the lifespan of the television is longer.
Besides this, many high-end laser TV models also feature true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, and a variety of cutting-edge technologies, which can give users an impressive viewing experience.
Talking about the fake demand, but is the demand for detailed products, the discussion of quality and investment, the light-electric-vide is not the film-and-audience's play, and it can try, all things are good, and it can try, all things are good, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and it can try, and
Simply put, ultra-wide angle close-in focus projector - laser television, in order to get close to the screen, cannot use expensive ultra-wide angle lens and reflective lens, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To shield some parts of the environment from light, use micro-structures, which are priced high, and the price of a 65-inch liquid crystal can be exchanged for a 80-inch liquid crystal.
There's another thing, I particularly dislike the mirror manufacturers taking mirrors with reflective lenses. It's a kind of mirror that reflects light onto the eyeglass, and it's a kind of mirror that reflects light onto the eyeglass. The mirror reflects light onto the eyeglass, and the eyeglass can't see the mirror. It's a kind of mirror that reflects light onto the eyeglass, and it's a kind of mirror that reflects light onto the eyeglass. The mirror reflects light onto the eyeglass, and the eyeglass can't see the mirror. It's a kind of mirror that reflects light onto the eyeglass, and it's a kind of mirror that reflects light onto the eyeglass. The mirror reflects light onto the eyeglass, and the eyeglass can't see the mirror. It's a kind of mirror that reflects light onto the eyeglass, and it's a kind of mirror that reflects light onto the eyeglass. The mirror reflects light onto the ey
And, if the projector screen was not reflective, the image would not be like.
The glare (glare) effect of the high brightness was reflected to the eyes, and a large amount of light was reflected to the eyes. This is the true discomfort.

I looked at the photos in the store before, and most of the outdoor wedding was taken, the photos were very bright, and the shooting style was very diverse.
After arriving, I talked with my sister about my own ideas, and I was very patient to help me try two outfits. I finally decided to start dressing up.

However, it may be because I didn't communicate with you in detail, so the photos may not be what I want, but it should be good to look at.
After the photos are taken, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, after the photos are taken, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures, and then, the photographer will help you choose the pictures,
The film should take about half a month, and wait for the effect.
The second round of the photo shoot activity - most of the clothes can choose a piece of photography.
Finally, I chose a black silk skirt to experience a different style.
The entire shooting process takes about two hours, makeup and shooting, the photographer is a 95-year younger brother, he feels a little uncomfortable, and he hopes to give more advice in the future.
Photography Gallery Choice Quality Shop
I'm on the first page, so come on over and see what Queenie has to offer.
Before going to the shop, fill in the name and phone number, and then choose the clothes, the wedding dress can be chosen, and then change three or four sets of clothes, and then wait for a long time, and the service attitude is good, and then, after shooting, you can take a photo, and the feeling of the face is good, and it will take about half a month, and three or four days will be sent, and the feeling is similar to the original picture.
The whole environment is good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are three make-up positions, and in the middle is a photo booth.
He is very enthusiastic and very attentive.
The sculptor has a lot of patience.
The photographer will also be very serious about the poses.
If the photographer is not satisfied, the photographer will initiate a re-shoot.
The experience may have been a bit too much, the original double eyelids were pasted with three eyelids.
The eyebrow was also shaved, and for the everyday no eyebrow, it was a bit annoying.
After ten days, pictures were given, but the effect was not satisfactory. I felt that the eyelids were still very obvious.
Because I wasn't sure what kind of style I wanted, I tried two outfits, and the result was to choose a black dress. My sister-in-law said that this outfit is a bit old-fashioned.
After choosing clothes, I started to do makeup. Makeup stylist and hairstylist little sisters are very patient in helping me to do makeup. The effect is very satisfactory.
After dressing up, I started taking photos. The photographer guided me to pose. The whole process was very easy and comfortable.
After shooting, I selected four pictures that I liked the most. The little boy said that the 15-minute film was very good. The result was very satisfactory.
It's been 3 days without a response... because your system can't recognize my credit card, so I can't join #PRS_ORG# plus the monthly fee plan!
The most bizarre thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay.
I have to pay the fare every time.
You can take a break until you finish your investigation, and then take my monthly fee, isn't it?
Do you buy an umbrella?
The small umbrella is an insurance intermediary platform.
According to the regulations of the Insurance Supervisory Commission (2015 revision), the insurance company must meet three conditions: the shareholders and the founders of the insurance company must have no major violations within the last three years, and the minimum capital of the insurance company must be RMB 5000 million.
These three are actually very strict, in summary, it is to have strength, to pass through the insurance supervisory agency (insurance supervisory agency, insurance bank) of the national authority department, shareholders have a good reputation, as the insurance insurance company's small umbrella insurance, and the insurance investor is not to have too many doubts about the small umbrella insurance. In fact, these three conditions are not what every insurance company can reach.
On this point, it's okay, and it's worth trusting.
From insurance products, the small umbrella insurance is a kind of insurance supermarket, many insurance companies' famous star disease insurance are sold in this platform, such as the latest launch of the super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super
From a payment model perspective, the Internet platform's products, because there is less operating expenses, and employee wages, and therefore the Internet platform products are priced higher, and therefore the Internet platform products are priced higher. Therefore, the Internet platform's products are priced higher, and the payment method is flexible, which supports monthly payments, and reduces the burden of insurance protection. At the same time, it can maximize the limit of the insurance protection.
This point is also very good.
You can think about it.
In terms of professionalism, this point is very important, because insurance is a very professional industry, and many Internet products customers can self-insure, this will cause many misconceptions, in health and professional fields, the insurance professionals will add their own subjective awareness, feel that they are healthy or meet the requirements, this will cause many misconceptions.
I used to work for "Tencent Weibo" (and Rain Umbrella, which is an Internet insurance platform) to sell insurance. I am very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is real, and it is reliable, not reliable, and there are many sales guides. The insurance of the Internet has no professional insurance personnel, and there are many sales guides.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 600,000 yuan, buying insurance gives a mobile phone, free of charge to receive 60,000 yuan, this kind of sales strategy is not wrong, but it is light, not to tell the insurance buyer, the first month is 1 yuan, the second month is required to pay the regular fees, a few dozens to 200, many customers will pay the fees for two years by themselves.
For $1 dollar, insurance companies will pay $600,000 (insured doughnuts).
Free shipping of mobile phones is sent with special protection numbers, such as 6666, 8888, and so on. If the short message is sent, and if you don't change, no one will remind you.
For the insurance person, it is also a pitfall. The insurance amount of 60,000 yen, is a short-term insurance, if only relying on this, there is no other business insurance, and if the real disaster occurs, 60,000 yen will not be able to solve the problem, and the life starts to be impovered.
Currently, on the insurance sales of the Internet, the country is also strict crackdown.
As a whole, the platform is not a problem, the products are not a problem, and the problem is the professionalism and business ethics of the staff.
Advise the comprehensive consideration and careful weighing, there are a lot of insurance companies' products, customers can choose more options and products, and some products' prices are better than the Internet products.
I have assisted 59 Internet customers, guaranteeing the downstream products, insurance fees per person is about 2000-3000 yuan per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me and communicate with me.
I: As an insurance broker, I have three years of business management experience, I have served more than 1,000 business users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies, and in the pre-sale stage, I will start from the customer's needs, and customize insurance products for the customers, and in the post-sale stage, I will try to get the best results for the customers, and in the post-sale stage, I will do the insurance certificates, and I will do the insurance certificates, and I will do the insurance certificates, and I will do the insurance certificates, and I will do the insurance certificates, and I will do the insurance certificates, and I will do the insurance certificates, and I will do the insurance certificates, and I will do the insurance certificates, and I will do the insurance certificates, and I will do the insurance certificates, and I will do the insurance certificates, and I will do the insurance certificates, and I will do the insurance certificates, and I will do the insurance certificates, and I
Growing with every customer.
I hope my answer can help the topic starter.
According to the definition of the insurance supervisory department, the Internet insurance is an insurance business carried out by the insured after clicking the insurance chain.
In this process, the insured person does not need to sign, and the insurance agent does not need to sign, all steps can be completed by the insured person himself.
Although the insurance policies are not very "ceremonial", it is possible that the paper-based version may not have, but this does not affect the validity and legal effectiveness of the electronic version.
This type of model is somewhat similar to the telephone sales line of work, but the purchase of insurance may have a fatal problem, which is that the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract of several years, and when we buy insurance, we should consider whether the insurance agent we choose is reliable or not. The insurance agent we choose should be able to be with us for a long period of time and provide services in the future.

Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of filth and trash talk, and I will not accept this kind of people's attack on me.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we should not tolerate this kind of evil.
If you don't look at the political party and the party faction, it is this kind of uncultured behavior.

After I reported the news, you were completely unresponsive, and instead became more belligerous.
I don't care what your political background is, and I don't care what your social status is. In our society, we need to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this kind of provocative, concealed, humiliating, and slanderous speech, and you can continue to say that you're only interested in me, and you can continue to acknowledge that it's not a provocation or you can continue to deny that it's not your conduct or you can continue to deny that it's not your conduct.
No, I can't, and I can't stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you, my appearance and body shape do not need you to comment.
I don't believe there is any woman who would want to humiliate herself in such a way.
My friend asked me, how's it going?
I say it's good, and you won't believe it.
I think no one girl will be able to say that she is still good after being bullied like this.
Whether it's in the workplace, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic decency will choose to hurt any woman.
I believe that the common way is in the heart of people.
I took a part of the comments to leave for you to judge.
If you post it yourself, no one should be able to fool you.
I can only say that you are a civilized enemy.

The U.S. Navy's aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan assembled in the vicinity of China's neighboring islands. On January 17th, 2022, the U.S. Navy's aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan flew to China's neighboring islands.

Meta fell 26% in the last week, with a market value of $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded to "a competition we have never seen before". Why?
Meta (the original Facebook) is a advertising company, its main revenue comes from advertisements, and today it is making money from advertisements.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functions, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only like this, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's advertising platform through Meta's advertising platform.
But the times have changed.
The first, due to the privacy policy adjustment of Meta, it is difficult to obtain user data information, which affects the advertisement placement efficiency.
Apple's current privacy policy makes it clear to users that they are not allowed to obtain information about themselves, and most people's normal response is definitely not allowed.
If Google continues to stab a knife at Meta's earnings, the impact on Meta's earnings will be even greater.
Secondly, Meta's revenue growth has weakened (this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Most people know that Meta is not doing business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly from companies doing business in China.
Meta has offices in Hong Kong for several hundred people, and there are several agents in mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is the most popular advertising channel, most of the money is given to Meta.
Interesting is that Meta's TT is Meta's main competitor, but two years ago Meta made a lot of money from characters.
Representatives from all over the country are advertising in Meta's territory, and Meta's performance in China is very good.
I haven't focused on it lately, but I'm sure it won't be better than before.
Chinese companies have passed the stage of large-scale burning money abroad.
The third is that the new channel expansion is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT within the platform, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the declining income, but the lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets are not just about current earnings, but also about future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are insufficient.
To tell a new story for the market, Zak Bragg talked about "metaverse".
The metaverse really should be the future's direction, but the metaverse's realization period is long, and this story should not support Meta's market value in the next two or three years.
So, in the next two years, it should be the most difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at the face book right now, there is a lot of $1 billion to $2 billion in revenue every year, but the face book is very vulnerable, compared to other internet companies and high tech companies, there is no good security.
Although his several social media applications are currently popular, it is the mainstream social media application, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. However, the face of TikTok's rapid development, the face book also has no confidence.
The concept of the metaverse, which cannot be achieved in a short period of time, is very dangerous. Therefore, the face book is very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg is changing the company's name and is looking for a new race track. But I think that his race track choice is wrong. It is the reason why I think that his race track choice is wrong. It is the reason why I think that his race track choice is wrong. It is the reason why I think that his race track choice is wrong. It is the reason why I think that his race track choice is wrong. It is the reason why I think that his race track choice is wrong. It is the reason why I think that his race track choice is wrong.
