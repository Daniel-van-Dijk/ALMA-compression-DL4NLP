Students sing lead roles at Zhejiang University Academic Conference; Research results make people's brains open up - Xinhuanet
Use air to wash your hands, diagnose diseases by puffing out your cheeks, and accurately find the source of haze. Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements were awarded.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers environmental, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, humanities education, etc. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions, some of which have won awards in China and internationally.
Biometric sensors: Your family doctor
PhD candidate Zhang Diyin's team demonstrated a bio-sensing device on a smartphone, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
All you have to do is breathe lightly into the device, and it will be able to detect your health condition from the composition of the air you exhale.
Zhang Di-ming explained that this sensor is connected to a smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the smartphone after breathing out the gas.
There are smart watches on the market that can detect one's health condition. Generally, they detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biological sensor uses graphene, a new material, and its target is chemical elements. Its keen "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the health condition of the body.
Smart surgical light: the doctor's high-energy eyes
Besides smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Swiss International Inventions Exhibition in Geneva this year.
Ju Linqi and Shen Junfei, a master's student from the Department of Optoelectronics and Engineering, opened a new perspective in the defects of traditional surgical lamp, and invented the intelligent LED surgical lamp without shadows.
Many early-stage diseases are not detected and surgically removed, and this is related to the light used in the operating room by surgeons. "
Shen Junfei said that if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues at the early stage of cancer detection, the cancer cells will spread out.
This smart surgical light has four lamps, which can adjust the light spectrum to enhance the difference between different tissues under the light.
During surgery, the surgeon can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness of the light, the spectrum, the evenness of color, and the non-glare at any time according to the requirements of the surgery and the personal habit.
This kind of intelligent surgical light has been used in the affiliated hospitals of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Children's Hospital, and other hospitals, and received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Use air to wash your hands: Water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by washing them with water and rubbing some soap, at most adding some hand soap, but Li Qichang and his classmates invented a "air hand washing device".
All we have to do is stand on the device's sink and our weight will compress the air out.
It's like a balloon.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the water faucet and combines with the water.
This way, we can get our hands clean! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiment proved that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of the common washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness and save up to 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environment-friendly.
Last year, this invention emerged from the top universities around the world and won the only gold medal at the Second Global Major Challenges Summit.
Please arrange to send it back to me as soon as possible, thank you.
Please cancel the order and return the cash, do not accumulate points, and do not use #PRS_ORG# in the future!
Bones and spicy peppercorns are not suitable for children to eat
If so, please order as soon as possible.
Not yet, thank you.
He told me to tell you guys where he is#PRS_ORG#
I don't wait, I cancel the order
I#PRS_ORG# bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can it be changed?
Or cancel the order
Okay, sorry for the inconvenience
I think it's a very important document - an emergency certificate.
This is one of the skills that I consider important, other than my driving license!
Let's get this out of the way: First aid is actually emergency first aid, which is what you do when an emergency happens, before the ambulance gets there.
It is well known that there is a period of time between the accident happening and the ambulance arriving, and it is this period of time that is the most crucial.
This is the time when urgent care is needed.
If I really do have a heart attack, a brain hemorrhage, and stop breathing, we have only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So how important it is for people around you to know first aid!
When people around us fall down, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them, rather than standing there dumbly and doing nothing. This feeling of helplessness is too scary.
In China, we have official data of 300,000 people dying unexpectedly each year, the most dangerous being cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 78 percent can be saved, Shanghai and Beijing are below 1 percent."
That's what the Founder of the First Reaction, Liu Lei, said.
If someone has a heart attack and stops breathing and their heart stops beating, you can't do anything.
Resuscitation is only possible if artificial respiration and chest compression are carried out.
I found that very few people have this awareness to learn CPR, but when the situation happens, it is too late. So I still call on everyone to learn CPR, so that we can react quickly when we face an emergency.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
First Aid certificates can be signed up for at your local Red Cross Training Centre, I signed up at the Red Cross Training Centre in Zhuhai. Students also get a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goal that needs to be completed before the age of 25. Putting the emergency card into the goal list is also something that happened a few months ago, but it is actually completed!
Next, I need to go to take other certificates that I want to take. I want to take a diving certificate. I saw that there was a diving emergency certificate in the small red book. I think that I need to have an emergency certificate before I can take the diving certificate. Therefore, the emergency certificate is still very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
The 13 yen shrimp dumpling is one!?
I've never done it.
How does #NAME# not write clearly?
One for $13?
Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# failed to deliver the meal, but this time I only got one shrimp dumpling!
Because I clearly saw that it was effective when I entered the code before.
First of all, I think that "Four Seas" is a bad film from all aspects. From various aspects, it is a bad film.
But you can't say that this film isn't a bright spot, and at least the music is pretty good.
There are many kinds of rotten movies, making you fall asleep in the cinema is one kind, making you watch it and get angry is another kind. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience. It can ignite your anger in various ways.
When it comes to insulting the audience, Han Xun is truly a genius.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation of the K system, which is hard to define and full of holes, like the windcoat on the back of the little guy.
Even after you've seen it, you'll wonder if there's a hidden allegory lurking in the background, but when you think about it, you realize it's just a pile of shit.
First, let's talk about some of the things that are hard for me to understand.
The protagonist's home should be somewhere in a small island in the south, and he should rely on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish of wanting to see snow, and then the story was arranged for her to go to the northeast to see snow.
Are elderly people sitting in a bread truck from the south to the northeast to see the snow?？
He and his father are very confident about this.
And that was the end of it.
Setting up a bar on a derelict ship, how did the woman and her brother get a liquor license?
Why is the island's flying car gangster light-hearted enough to close off a section of mountain road?
Then the truck carrying steel bars stopped in the middle of the road, and the drivers of the trucks around it could not be found.
This is too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a small-time crook with a bad credit record become a traffic cop?
Why didn't you call the police? Why did the police ask if you were in trouble?
An adult knows how to use smartphones, but does not know how to open the door of the hotel room, and then forcefully arrange to find the owner of the hotel?
This nonsensical plot is all over the film, and it's so ridiculous that it's painful to remember it.
Besides the plot, the worst thing about the film is its theme, or rather, there is no theme at all. It's just a sewn-together monstrosity.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy film, 20 minutes later you will guess that it may be a motivation film, and after watching half of the film, you will think that it may be a film showing the difficulties of young people in small towns, and after watching the film, you will feel that you don't know what kind of film you watched. Along with this, you will have doubts about yourself, and you will wonder why you ran to the cinema to watch the film.
For most people, in fact, they are very familiar with all kinds of film tricks. For example, if you want to make a motorcycle film, you should have ambition + comedy, and then tell the audience that a talented rookie is how to step by step to success.
If you want to make a romance film, then you should tell the story of young men and waitresses in a small town and their grudges.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your plot cannot contain things that are out of step with the normal world.
(like the character played by Yin Zheng, who was just burned, and then was able to sing). It is impossible to come up with some brainstorms that can not be resisted by Kenny Di.
As for the female lead who is clearly not a weak-minded person but acts like a five-year-old in some aspects, I really don't know whether it is due to the acting skills or the requirements of the director.
There's another thing I don't quite understand, why a racing driver like Han Han would be so keen on adding a crash scene to his own film?
This kind of film arrangement in the Spring Festival, is it to block the audience?

Chongqing Vocational Schools Pilot Modern Apprenticeship - Xinhua News
Yesterday, reporters learned from the City Education Commission that from this year onwards, the city will try out the “modern apprenticeship” talent cultivation mode in 60 middle schools, and the students who are accepted for the trial will have both apprentice and employee status at the same time. After being accepted for the trial, the students will be pre-recorded by the trial enterprises.
The city education commission required that the regulations on the recruitment and employment of vocational schools be standardized, and clearly defined the dual identity of the vocational school students and the employees of the enterprises. The vocational school students and the employees of the enterprises should sign a three-party agreement, and the vocational school students who are 16 years old but not 18 years old should be signed by the vocational school students, the guardians, the vocational school and the enterprises. The vocational school students and the guardians, the vocational school and the enterprises should sign an agreement to determine the details of the vocational school students’ on-the-job training and the contents of the vocational school education, as well as the rights and interests of the vocational school students.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms with cooperative enterprises to carry out pre-employment training and on-the-job training.
Pilot schools should reform their talent cultivation mode.
The school and the enterprise jointly designed the talent cultivation plan, jointly formulated the professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, master teacher standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plan.
The pilot is based on the cultivation of professional talents, and the students’ internship time is determined according to the cultivation plan of professional talents. The internship is generally for 6 months.
The enterprise practice should implement the enterprise group management mode. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can guide 2 to 5 apprentices, forming a learning group to ensure that the students are proficient in each round of training.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city will establish 60 city-level modern apprenticeship training points in three batches. Each training point will have about 50 apprentices (apprentices). In total, about 3,000 apprentices (apprentices) will be trained.
According to the principle of first trial and then promotion, from point to surface step-by-step promotion, explore the establishment of the college-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and unified education, and effectively improve the students’ job skills and improve the students’ employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Omicron spreads fast but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant is more mild than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Limpopo province reported that the symptoms of patients they are currently treating for COVID-19 are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing.
The organization's medical director, Unben Pillay, said he sees dozens of patients each day, but none need hospitalization.
Pilley said: "They are able to control the disease at home, most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation. "
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to become severely ill from a coronavirus infection.
He said that, compared with the situation in the previous Delta epidemic, the new coronavirus patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low oxygen saturation.
Many people will end up in hospital within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although collecting enough data will take several weeks, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of those hospitalized with COVID-19 were severely ill, which is only half of the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave; the average length of hospital stay was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of those hospitalized with COVID-19 died, while in the early outbreak of COVID-19 in South Africa, the death rate was 20%.
The head of the Africa Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, citing data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, said: "So far, almost all indicators point to a mild disease."
He also said: "It's still early, we need to get late data.
Typically, hospitalization and death occur later, and we entered this wave of the pandemic only two weeks ago. "
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalisations, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although delta remains the world's most prevalent coronavirus variant, omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the province saw a 400% increase in new cases in the first week of December, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for 90% of the cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education at the time: How to rescue abducted children?
If the famous public welfare advertisement "there is no buying and selling, there will be no killing," then, in the good environment where there is no "trafficking" demand, group defense and group prevention, and all-round anti-trafficking, the trafficking crimes will not occur frequently.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched the urgent disclosure platform for missing children.
This is a channel of authority for establishing a credible channel for publishing information on missing children, and an Internet information platform for recovering missing children.
When I heard the name of this app, I felt warm.
The new technology method is not only named "art and sentiment", but also informationized and effective.
The first priority of anti-trafficking law enforcement is to recover the kidnapped children and protect their safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
Meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be enumerated with many "big words".
But before the cases of trafficking are solved, priority should be given to the safety of the victims.
The difference between urgent and non-urgent, under the urgent "rescue" purpose, there are many controversial topics such as "whether the kidnapped children should be subject to the death penalty" and so on. These controversial topics can be postponed for the time being. However, the rescue of kidnapped children should not be delayed.
Based on the experience of such cases, human traffickers tend to leave the scene as soon as they get their hands on the victims.
Each delay of one minute means that the child will be further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
In this situation, the use of methods such as the "round-face" platform, which directly helps to solve the case and find the child, is an effective action.
After all, "fighting trafficking" is a task that requires the entire judicial system to operate.
The protection of children and parents' rights, the improvement of legislation, the protection of justice, and the vigilance of law enforcement, all need to be carried out in accordance with the concept of "protecting children and caring for the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can be done better.
For example, in one common case, a family of three was resting at a railway station, and the parents were sleeping. When they woke up, they discovered that their child was missing.
You can't expect a two-year-old to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have some awareness of protection.
Both parents taking turns to rest, or putting the child in a safe place, are the most basic measures to prevent children from being kidnapped.
From the other side of the law enforcement against the trafficking of abducted children, the buyers of the abducted children should also be paid attention and punished.
Individual acts of wrongdoing are often only one link in a long chain.
According to China’s Criminal Law, the minimum punishment for trafficking in children is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty and confiscation of property may be imposed.
The higher the sentence, the heavier the punishment, in the trend of "light punishment", the kidnapping of children is obviously a serious crime.
There are still many cases of kidnapping for ransom every year.
It can be seen that some people have outdated views on raising children, and their legal awareness is shallow.
The legal education of this part of people should keep pace with it.
To effectively control the crime of kidnapping and selling, it is not enough to rely on the strict law enforcement of the government.
If there is a wide-spread "market" for snatching, the snatchers will be greedy, and they will continuously invent new ways of snatching, forming a "duel" situation with the law enforcers, and the anti-snatching action will inevitably fall into a low-efficiency quagmire.
Therefore, overcoming the backward mentality, popularizing legal knowledge, will also help to eradicate the trafficking and buying of children.

No more, thank you.

That restaurant has always said they were in the middle of handling it.
I waited for a few hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil, with five grades.
Pure olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is extracted directly from freshly harvested olive fruits by mechanical cold pressing, filtration, and removal of impurities.
According to the acidity, it can be divided into three grades:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Extra Virgin): This is the highest grade of olive oil, with the highest quality. It is a pure natural product.
The flavour is sublime, with a mild floral aroma and acidity of no more than 1%.
High-quality extra-virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): acidity slightly higher than 2%, but not more than 2%, flavor pure and fragrant.
Common Extra Virgin Olive Oil: Taste and flavor are still acceptable, acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil whose acidity exceeds 3.3%.
Olive oil can be refined into two grades:
Common Olive Oil: refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of freshly pressed olive oil to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%. It has a pale golden color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): It is extracted from the oil cake by dissolution method and purified.
If you're familiar with the grading system, you've probably noticed that olive oil's acidity is a very important indicator.
You need to know that olives are like grapes in that they come from different regions, different varieties of olives, and produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow olive trees:
The coastal areas of the Mediterranean have the most suitable soil and climate conditions for the growth of olive trees, including temperature, sunshine, humidity, and rainfall.
Apart from the coastal areas of the Mediterranean, other areas can only be planted in zero-star habitats.
Main producing countries (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Yemen, and Bahrain, and other countries with similar climate, such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc.
Olive harvest month:
Every year from 3 to 6 June is the time for the olive tree to bloom and bear fruit. From 7 to 10 October, the fruit begins to develop and ripen, changing from green to red, purple and black.
November to February is the harvest season for olives (freshness of olive oil is very important).
The nutritional composition of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable of all oils for human nutrition.
Democracy Summit Ends, Biden Says Freedom's Flame Will Never Go Out
The virtual "Democracy Summit" led by U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday (Dec. 10) concluded with the participation of governments from 110 countries, civil society and private sector leaders.
Biden said in his closing remarks that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and that totalitarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that the plan is to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwan's government representative and Executive Committee member Tang Fung and Hong Kong's pro-democracy human rights activists Lo Hui-chang also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know just how daunting the work is that lies before us.
But we also know that we can meet challenges, because we have said in the past that democratic world is everywhere.
The totalitarian regime can never extinguish the flame of freedom. It burns in the hearts of people all over the world and in every corner of the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
He said: "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen democracy's guardrails, drive reform, and realize transparent governance, as well as resisting the force of authoritarianism, the shockwaves and impacts of that, as well as those who seek power before the public interest."
The second day of the "Democracy Summit" focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy, and resisting digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, also said in his opening speech on that day that democracy is facing challenges all over the world, especially with the challenges brought by new digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reiterate common values and stances and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving inequality issues, fighting corruption, updating the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also needs to condemn all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by technological revolution. "
Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Lo Tong-sung delivered a pre-recorded video message to the conference, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, including Hong Kong and the Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been accepting China's rise, but there has been no mechanism to hold it accountable.
That's why politicians and community leaders need to work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure the restoration of democracy is our first priority. "
Roland Chin also called on the free world to unite against the threat posed by the CPC.
He said: "Some of you may be afraid of angering Xi Jinping, some of you may not want to lose the Chinese market, and some of you may not realize (the CPC) poses a threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
This is also the reason we need to change. "
Tang Fei, a member of the Executive Yuan's Executive Committee, delivered a speech at the roundtable discussion on "Fighting Digital Dictatorship and Defending Democratic Values" via video and stressed that Taiwan is standing on the frontline of resisting authoritarianism and tyranny.
He also shared how information transparency and building mutual trust can counter the COVID-19 pandemic.
He said, "At a time when democracy is on the rise in Taiwan, we have always stood firmly on the frontline of confronting authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments across the world have used public health and collective interest as an excuse to rationalize violations of human rights, and global democracy is showing signs of regression.
But in Taiwan, we don't need to shut down the city to control the epidemic, and we don't need to take down the shelf to defeat false information. "
At the same time as the agenda of the "Democratic Summit" was being carried out, the US Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea, and other countries, and at the same time, it would impose investment restrictions on a Chinese company that uses surveillance technology to help violate human rights.
I have already taken pictures and uploaded them to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying the delivery time.
Originally, you had to #NUMBER#
In the end, I didn't call.
I didn't eat.
I will definitely complain.
You can't send it, how come you didn't talk about it earlier?
I've been waiting for you for so long
No, I didn't get a call.

I want to cancel my order.
Why not cancel it?
Hello, the restaurant's water chicken is fresh.
I want to try my hand at tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a price that's close to it.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is proportional to the level of friendliness, and if you can't tell the difference, the expensive one will be friendlier than the cheap one, and this kind of "entry-level camera" is actually industrial waste.
They are very weak, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, and the hard ball cannot withstand it. Skilled players find it difficult to handle.
Their logic and subtext is - well, it's hard to play tennis, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to pay a lot for it, so you get a cheap one and play it a couple of times, and then you don't want to play it anymore.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have made progress, and then you can come to this place to buy expensive things. I will make two times of money.
Suggesting a similar price, buy a second-hand good one, choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so the good racket is not expensive, the new racket is 500 or 600, and the second-hand racket is 200, do you enjoy the racket with 1000 yuan?
Friendly to newbies, but once you pass the newbie stage, it gets tough, but most people, especially women, don't pass the newbie stage.
Orders have been repeatedly delayed.
Can you help me follow up on this?
Delay
Thank you.
In fact, I already have credit?
Do I need to reorder now? I don't need to worry about the original order, right?
Hello, I ordered this restaurant's food, but it was lacking a lot, and the chicken was also fresh.
#PRS_ORG# doesn't have any reason to say that I should take it. Please cancel it.
The order I placed was for delivery, and there is no self-pickup in this case.

In fact, there are a lot of requirements for the dressing and matching for the girls who are a little fat.
Fat girls should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be just long enough to cover the knees and just long enough to cover the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, the fat on the legs will be exposed.
If it's too long, it will give the impression of being short and fat.
If you wear it from top to bottom in three sections, it will make you look taller naturally. The top, skirt and ankle boots with different colors will produce a sense of elongation.
In fact, a lot of dark-colored clothing is the standard for slender girls (this is something the author is familiar with). Dark colors are also a good way to conceal your body's fat, and black short skirts are the first choice for slender girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially a short skirt in black, will make you look a bit slimmer.
If your legs are very fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too conspicuously.
The more popular it is, the better. And the colors shouldn't be too bright.
To prevent people from paying attention to your legs and feet, make people feel fat.
For girls who are slightly overweight, it is important to learn how to dress appropriately.
Fat girls should not wear tight short skirts, and the shirt should not be too short or stuffed in the skirt. It will make people feel uncomfortable. If you have fat legs, you should wear black long socks or mesh socks (the kind with holes). Choose a floral skirt with soft fabric, and pair it with a shirt with a high collar. It can hide the fat girl's shortcomings well.
Of course, slender girls also have their own ways of wearing short skirts.
If you're wearing a short skirt, you should choose a top that matches the short skirt's color, which will make you look taller.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most IN this summer!
If you are plump in the upper part, but your legs are very thin, you can recommend to choose the glamorous feeling of the short skirt.
It can not only hide your big belly, but also show your advantages.
A-line short skirts will make you look thin, which is more suitable for fat girls. Tight-fitting tops will create a layered effect, which will make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt can be paired with a short skirt. Fat girls can also give it a try.
Fat girls can also be stylish.
As long as they can grasp the rules of dressing and matching, thin girls will also be the focus of attention.
In terms of dressing up and matching, there has been a change, so in life, we should also exercise more, so that we can get rid of the label of micro-fat girl earlier.

The girl volunteered to be an arrow target for her sister to raise money: "It's better to be hurt by the skin and meat" - Xinhuanet
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board in Hangzhou Wulan Plaza. The wooden board was inscribed with the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan per shot".
Yesterday morning, a photo of a “Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a target for her sister to donate” went viral on WeChat.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a wooden board that is slightly taller than her, with the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan per shot" written on it, indicating that people can pay money to use the bow and shoot.
The act triggered heated discussions among netizens.
Yesterday, the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau Sub-City Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police had confirmed that the girl was the sister of the girl who donated money. However, this kind of behavior is not worth advocating. After being advised, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl, 12, who was used as 'archery target' for street fundraiser, warned
A long-haired girl is standing in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan per shot" written on it. The wooden board in front of her is also inscribed with her silver bank account number and WeChat and Alipay account numbers.
The image caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believed that this was a “shameless begging act”. Some netizens also expressed their sympathy.
We discovered this situation at around 10:00 am on the morning of the 23rd, when we were patrolling around the square. At that time, there were a lot of onlookers. "
The nearby Tianxiang police station received the reporters of the local media and said that there were two girls in the age of 20 or so, who were dressed in a fashionable way.
Among them, the girl who played the "human-meat target" cried all the time, asking passers-by to play the game; another girl was on the side, helping to shout, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery fees.
We made contact with local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister with leukemia. "
Last night, the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xiacheng Sub-Bureau's publicity responsible person told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Jiajia Li, and she was the sister of Jiajia Yan.
However, due to the need to spend more than 30,000 yuan for treatment, he could not think of a good way to raise funds, so he did this.
He said that during the process, the two girls, one was the target, and the other was the shooter, but they did not participate in the process. During the process, no one shot the arrow, but there were people watching and taking pictures and posting them on Weibo.
The police later determined that the bow and arrows used were not within the scope of regulation.
The spokesperson said, "We are not advocating to take this type of eye-drop fundraising."
After being warned by the police officers at the police station, she has left the police station.

What was hot in 2021?
There is no doubt that it is the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
A few months ago, there was an article titled "Watch Out! Project Managers Can Win Gold Medals at the Olympic Projects," which was very popular. It mentioned that project managers were definitely the first to go, and no one could compete with them: moving bricks, going on business trips, staying up all night was the daily routine for project managers, and they also had to rescue, take the blame, and apologize.
A seemingly light-hearted article, however, also reveals the daily hardships of project managers, which represent the lack of enthusiasm for the current project management work.
Those involved in project management also gradually choose some actions to get out of the dilemma in their work.
The number of people registering for the PMP (Project Management Professional) qualification, an internationally recognised qualification for project management professionals, has been on the rise every year. More and more project management professionals are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the China Project Management 20-Year Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, there were nearly 60,000 people who applied for the PMP® exam, and about 42,000 people passed the PMP® exam. There were about 30,000 effective holders of the PMP® certificate, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP® certificate holders.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMPs who are certified has steadily increased, indicating that more and more project managers are realizing that it is no longer possible to rely on the "old experience" to get things done. The ever-changing work environment has made us realize that we need to learn how to stand on the shoulders of science giants to explore the way ahead.
However, having a PMP certification will ensure that project management work will run smoothly, right?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically grasp the ten major domains and five major process groups of project management, but they still don't know what to do when they actually work on project management.
Many project managers often report the following problems: The project management knowledge is not adequate, relying solely on personal experience; there is no practical application of project management theories; there is no systematic project management procedures to support the work; the project estimation is not accurate, and the control sensitivity is poor; the project drags and drags; the team members are unclear about their responsibilities, and the “old oil sticks” do not know how to deal with; the cross-department cooperation is not smooth, and the team members do not know how to deal with the “old oil sticks”; the cross-department cooperation is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance ……

Jiacheng urges consumers to practice rational consumption on the eve of "Double 12" - Economic Observation - a professional financial news website
This year's "Double 11" madness festival, the national Internet payment business transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, which is higher than the previous year.
The diversity of red envelopes and live broadcasts that grab people's eyes once again make consumers feel gain, and this wave of consumer enthusiasm not only makes people marvel at the strength of national consumption, but also makes them reflect on the influence of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer group.
On the eve of "Double 12", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a rational consumption advocacy to remind all users, especially young people, to establish good consumption habits and avoid blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People’s Bank of China this year, the Consumer Financial Literacy Index of the whole country was 66.81, which was 2.04 higher than that in 2019.
In general, our citizens' performance in financial consumption is good, but in terms of different aspects of financial behavior and skills, there is a large disparity, and there is still a need to further improve the basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old one young" will still be the focus of continuous attention of financial education. The report released by Nielsen and CCTV Finance showed that the young generation has huge potential for consumption, and credit consumption has become an important channel for upgrading consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of the young people have no debt accumulation. Although the young generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, there are some young people who have excessive consumption and follow the trend, and some young people have accumulated huge debt pressure and debt risks, and even caused social problems to increase. Financial institutions should bravely assume social responsibility and guide in a positive direction.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, JieXin has always strived to help citizens build their own happy life by providing quality and attentive services. It advocates that consumers should build up a correct and reasonable consumption view, and actively responds to the supervisory calls, and improves the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young groups.
Over the past years, JCB has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial education activities targeting young people, including university students, and has carried out various forms of innovative activities through cooperation with top universities to guide young people to form a rational consumption view, help them build a rational consumption view, reasonably guide their consumption needs, and help them accumulate their life savings.
On the eve of Double 12, Jiexin reminded all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable consumption concept and a correct money view, resist impulsive consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumption loans, so as to avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
Consumers must plan ahead and pay on time.
If you are overdue, your overdue record will be recorded in your credit report, which may affect your economic life in the future, such as buying a car and buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions are qualified to operate.
In the future, Jiaxin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously update its financial products to provide consumers with services that are more in line with their needs and more diversified. It will help consumers continuously improve their financial knowledge, help consumers develop a rational consumption habit, and help consumers cultivate the concept of moderate borrowing.

Vietnam People's Newspaper - Gulf Cooperation Council responds to common challenges
Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stopover included Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Noteworthy is that this is the first time since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed sanctions on Qatar in mid-2017, triggering a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf, that Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, visits Qatar.
Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed an embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the SCO, and have had a negative impact on the economy of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, with all Gulf countries signing an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors.
The Gulf Arab states have resolved their differences to restore relations with Qatar based on the need to unite for the interests of all countries and the region's stability.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to establish the first direct land route between the two neighboring seas.
The 725-kilometre link between the two countries will provide convenience for citizens of both countries to travel and supply chain integration.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and two companies signed a memorandum of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincides with Iran's negotiations with the world's major countries on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear agreement between Iran and the world.
The Persian Gulf countries have always seen Iran as a long-term "rival" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to the region's security.
The Persian Gulf countries believe that without solving the Iranian missile issue, no action should be taken to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of the nuclear talks between major countries and Iran failing to meet the expectations of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct talks.
Its aim is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the economic growth of the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first time since some member nations ended their dispute with Qatar that the Gulf Cooperation Council nations hold a summit.
This is a reassessment of the contribution made by the Gulf Cooperation Council to promote the restoration of the Gulf Cooperation Council's unity, as well as a range of measures to facilitate the cooperation of its member states to address the common challenges, in order to make a contribution to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.
It hasn't been delivered from 7am to now 9.30am and I have to refund the deposit and cancel the order.
It's good.
It claims to be the loudest exhaust sound in the New Mountain area!
This time, we brought this car to you, which is many men's dream!
It's Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement - the Aventador LP700-4!
The price is nearly RMB200,000, the road tax is RMB10,000 per year, four-wheeled drive, why it is called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
I don't know either. According to the data, the acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h only takes 2.9 seconds, which is about the time it takes for myvi to reach 30 km/h.
The low-slung body, the boastful scissor doors, the huge intakes all over the body, and the 6.5-litre V12 under the glass, perfectly epitomize the Lamborghini style.
Explaining the down payment does not need to say too much, you can Google it yourself. The editor has summarized some explanations that Google may not give.
Too much attention, going where everyone is looking, it's uncomfortable! (It's actually kind of fun).
1km of petrol costs RM1 (the driver doesn't care).
Practice getting in and out of the car a bit, or else you'll feel a bit awkward (because you'll get stuck halfway out of the car).
The sound of the engine is too loud, and after getting out of the car, you will suddenly become deaf. (But it's still fun).
The car is too big to fit into a normal parking space. It is scary to get hit by a car that opens its door while parked next to you!
A bit lonely, because there is no competitors on the road (talked by myself, has nothing to do with the car owner, ha ha).
Please don't misunderstand, this video's supercar is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to film a video of their beloved car are welcome to contact us.
More car news you don't know about, right here at The Car Guide / People's Car
We're talking about a million-dollar crash!
The Bugatti Chiron and the Porsche 911 are two cars that car enthusiasts are familiar with. The Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the Porsche 911 is in the million-dollar range.
That day, a foreign country crashed a million Porsche 911 and a billion Chiron in just a few minutes!
The result justifies the price.
Let the university spirit and the era spirit resonate at the same frequency - New China
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of academic concepts and values pursued by a university over a long period of time. It is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present day, university spirit has played an important role in the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, and society, as well as the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the first modern university in the world, universities have borne a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For China’s universities, they emerged in the fall of the nation’s crisis, and their spirit has been deeply influenced by the traditional culture and the changes of the times. They advocate the values of “educating the people and benefiting the world” and “strengthening the nation through education”.
At present, the trend of higher education informationization and internationalization is becoming increasingly apparent, and the global competition of education, technology, and talent is intensifying. The higher education industry, as an important “supply-side” in the global competition, is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the release of the "Overall Plan for Coordinated Development of World-class Universities and World-class Disciplines" has shown China's confidence and determination to move from being a major country in higher education to becoming a strong country in higher education. At the same time, it has also put forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to speed up the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines in a relatively short period of time, given that there is still a certain gap?
Besides, the universities should also have three kinds of advantages: one is the later advantage, which is to attract outstanding scholars from overseas and learn from the advanced experience of world-class universities, so that the academic level and the quality of the university can be significantly improved; the second is the cultural advantage, which is to inherit the wisdom of Chinese civilization that has been accumulated for 5,000 years, and to promote the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to unite the power, shape the brand, and enhance the image; and the third is the system advantage, which is to strengthen the driving force of the socialist state, to pool the consensus of the community, to optimize the resource allocation, so as to provide a sustainable guarantee for the university to catch up with the advanced level of world-class universities.
It is important to realize that building world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach, and each school must display its own characteristics and characteristics.
The school’s characteristics should have both common Chinese characteristics and unique characteristics of each school’s goals, traditions, and resources.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects: the first is to highlight the talent cultivation of innovation and entrepreneurship, build an integrated environment for education and industry integration, and form a complete chain of entrepreneurship education ecological system; the second is to highlight the interdisciplinary congregation, promote the optimization and adjustment of disciplines, and promote the congregation of interdisciplinary new emerging disciplines and flagship interdisciplinary achievements; and the third is to highlight the management system and social services, deepen international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the Zhejiang University production-industry-research cooperation system.
In this process, the most important thing is to always uphold the spirit of the university and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, "Seeking the truth and pursuing innovation" is the school motto, "Study hard, cultivate morality, make distinctions, and be persistent" is the common value system, and "receiving the waters of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, opening up the minds of the people, and planting the Chinese nation" are the newest expression system of Zhejiang University's spirit.
This is the school’s firm adherence to the correct way of running the school and its continuous accumulation of cultural heights and the concentration of spiritual power. It is rich in content, and its significance is deep and far-reaching.
Among them, “Hayuan River” emphasizes the openness and inclusiveness of the spirit, which reflects the spirit of “I use all the talents of the world for my own use”; “Pursue Truth and Cultivate Morality” emphasizes the pursuit of truth and the cultivation of morality, which reflects the spirit of “seeking the truth and nurturing morality”; “Open the Way to the People” emphasizes the spirit of reform and innovation, which reflects the spirit of “seeking the truth and pursuing innovation”; and “Plant My Country” emphasizes the spirit of patriotism, which reflects the spirit of “loving my country and serving my country”.
This series of spiritual ideals and value pursuits is the essence of 120 years of teaching at Zhejiang University.
“A wise man hears what is said in silence, and a clear-sighted man sees what is not yet formed”.
Chinese universities should stand more firmly on the socialist cause of China, deeply grasp the time-space position and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, upholding humanistic care and independent freedom, so that the university spirit and the time spirit, the national spirit, and the national spirit are mutually stimulated, and provide endless energy for the realization of the nation’s prosperity and the revival of the Chinese nation, as well as for the realization of the common aspiration of humanity.

At the height of the NFT frenzy, the cryptocurrency community has come up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic started to earn stable income in this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, which combines various gameplay with NFT. It is currently the highest trading volume NFT project, with more than $3 billion in trading volume.
TokenTerminal data showed that Axie Infinity's daily income exceeded $8.2 million, approaching the revenue of PUBG.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity announced that its daily active users exceeded 100,000.
Axie Infinity's hot streak will spread a new "palytoearn" model to more people, thanks to the help of blockchain and smart contracts. Players are no longer a single role, besides getting fun and economic income from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This identity is not given by the game developers, but is guaranteed by the blockchain technology.
The biggest feeling I got from the news about a friend's stock was the choice of the industry on the track. That is, the choice of the industry of the investment target, which is the choice of the industry with a large growth space of more than 1 trillion; secondly, the choice of the industry with a good growth prospect in the future; and finally, the choice of the industry with the support of policies.
The width of the race track reflects the size of the market, the length of the race track reflects the development stage of the industry, and the smoothness of the race track reflects the competition pattern of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the adjustment of tactics in 2021 and adjust the tactics in 2022.
Tactics are about "doing the things right," which means doing things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," which means doing the right thing.
The strategy is about finding a direction, the tactics are about landing, and there is a space for strategic thinking above most tactical considerations.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) can be considered whether to continue to deepen the current field or to extend the lateral field (strategic thinking); for example, how to increase the retention rate (tactical thinking) can be considered how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); for example, how to increase the participation rate (tactical thinking) can be considered how to set up the correct KPIs to achieve the correct goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and precision recruitment; for example, how to increase the DAU (tactical thinking) can be considered whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin reached several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador became the first country or region in the world to make Bitcoin its official currency.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the ProShares company's launch of a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange. This marked the first regulated Bitcoin futures ETF to land the U.S. capital market, and the expansion of investment in cryptocurrencies was again enlarged.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
In November 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork called "Taproot," which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data load of transactions.

Asian American group files complaint against Yale, other Ivy League schools for discrimination - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) American 130 ethnic groups submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting against the discrimination against Asian applicants by three elite universities – Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Coalition, which spearheaded the complaint, held a news conference in Washington, D.C., the same day.
The chairman of the group, Zhao Yuzhong, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American prestigious universities increased exponentially in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian applicants in these three American prestigious universities remained basically the same.
Many studies have shown that these elite universities engage in the so-called "holistic admissions" process with "sustained and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants."
Zhao Youquan explained that in 2014, Sanders and other scholars found that in these three universities, the relative number of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students among all members of the Ivy League, and Yale University and Brown University had been practicing de facto racial quotas on Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yulong told Xinhua News Agency reporter that they hope that the US Department of Education and Justice Department can investigate after submitting the appeal, and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in their recruitment.
They also hope that the schools that are being sued can proactively address this issue and change their admissions policies for Asians.
So far, the three universities have not responded to the complaints.
The Asian Coalition for Education was founded in 2015, when it filed a complaint against Harvard University's admissions process, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint.
In addition to the Chinese American groups, other ethnic groups such as Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American educational groups also participated in the complaint.
You need cutlery.
Just canceled the order.
Why is it still being carried out?
Can you check to see if it has been cancelled?
But I ordered at 5:59 a.m.
That's the reservation line, and they don't know what they're talking about.
Is there a phone number I can call to reach them?
In September 2020, Mr. Li learned about a factory from a real estate agency. After visiting the factory several times, Mr. Li decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Liu paid a deposit of RMB200,000 to the owner of the factory building.
Lin made his signature on the "Purchase Deposit Receipt" indicating that he was the recipient of the deposit. The document stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller. The parties agreed to sign an agreement within one week."
However, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of the factory building and the payment method, which resulted in the delayed signing of the house purchase contract.
After considering the fact that the two parties could not reach an agreement on the content of the contract, a few days later, Linn deposited the 200,000 yuan deposit back to Mr. Liu.
After a long wait, he finally found a house that he liked. He paid the deposit and was ready to sign the contract. However, the seller refused to sell the house, which made Liu Xinsheng feel helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Liu filed a lawsuit to the Yuyang City People’s Court.
The court judged that the two parties did not sign a formal contract and could not solely blame the defendant. Therefore, the defendant did not need to bear the double return of the deposit penalty.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the second trial court upheld the original verdict.
In the transaction process, you need to fulfill your due diligence obligation.
At the time of signing the contract, as the buyer, you need to fulfill your due diligence obligations, such as verifying the property owner's information, whether the property has been occupied by someone else, and clearly stating the specific time and place for the delivery of the property in the contract, so as to prevent disputes from arising when the contract is carried out.
China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Saturday (Dec. 12) that the U.S. held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" was "drawing a line between ideology, turning democracy into a weapon, and using the name of democracy to cover up anti-democratic activities, stirring against each other, and shifting domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and value system on people and promoted "democratic reform", practiced unilateral sanctions, instigated "color revolution", and caused disastrous consequences.
Democracy has become America's "weapon of mass destruction" for meddling in other countries.
This summit is President Biden fulfilling his campaign promise.
The two-day conference was held via video conference, with leaders from 111 countries invited to attend, including Taiwanese leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States did not have the right to hold such a summit.
Internally and internationally, there is criticism of the invitees, including some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect that the Biden administration's true intention is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes in organizing this summit.
Germany's new chancellor, Angela Merkel, also attended the video democracy summit.
China's Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American democratic disease has become apparent. Money politics, identity politics, opposition between political parties, polarization, radicalization, social division, racial conflict, and the disparity between rich and poor have become more and more serious." The American democracy is built on the basis of capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech, "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, drive reform, and realize transparent governance, as well as resisting the forces of authoritarianism, and those who seek power at the expense of the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not a given, "we have to renew it in every generation," he said, "and that's a defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that "democracy and human rights" are facing "continuous and worrying challenges" and "democracy needs champions to defend it."
U.S. officials pledged to take action after the summit, including a $424.4 million proposal to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that all countries will make specific public commitments before the scheduled physical democratic summit at the end of 2022 to improve their democratic systems.
Biden said, "Let's get all our countries to fulfill our commitment and report our progress next year."
I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.

Educational Thinking: How University Entrance Exam Makes “Aces” and “Dregs” Get What They Deserve - New China
Three students from Lanzhou Traffic University wrote letters to the school leaders, expressing their confusion about the college entrance examinations, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examinations, change the examination types, and let the examinations truly reflect the students' real abilities.
Indeed, university entrance exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In the university campus, students come from five lakes and four oceans, with different abilities and different levels of learning.
It is difficult to assess a group that has so many different characteristics. There are different perceptions.
Of course, if the test questions are monotonous and repeated, and the questions are too simple, there will be another kind of feeling.
Students who don't work hard may be able to pass the entrance exam with a concentrated attack, but if they want to try other ways, they may achieve the effect of double the effort.
As a result, "study slackers" who do not put in any effort can pass the exams and even get high scores; "study bullies" who do not miss any classes can get good grades.
It seems that the students of Lanzhou Institute of Informatics reflect the problems that exist in university entrance examinations. It is believed that such a situation also exists in Lanzhou Institute of Informatics and not only in Lanzhou Institute of Informatics.
From this perspective, we should give a thumbs-up to these three students who wrote letters of self-denunciation.
In fact, those who have graduated from university are all aware of the fact that there are many ways to obtain examination questions from teachers, expand the examination scope, and seek to obtain high-level tutoring before the examination. The phenomenon of obtaining examination questions from teachers through surprise attacks, obtaining examination questions before the examination, and obtaining high-level tutoring after the examination is not uncommon. The phenomenon of obtaining examination questions from teachers after the examination and obtaining high-level tutoring before the examination is also not uncommon.
In the author's view, the assessment of the quality of teaching is guided by the evaluation of whether a university is qualified or not. The assessment of the university's qualification is based on the comprehensive grasp of the teacher's teaching and the scientific formulation of the question.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the major begins to subdivide, and most of the major courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no room for doubt that the basic knowledge points of a discipline must be comprehensively grasped. This is what is tested in university entrance examinations.
At the undergraduate level, most of the basic knowledge is basic theories and basic knowledge. From the perspective of knowledge points, there is little change, and it is basically fixed.
As the teacher said, "20 years ago, the basic knowledge of university mathematics was taught, and it is still taught, and it is still the focus. "
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, and this does not mean that the examination questions are monotonous and repeated.
In most universities, exams are usually composed by a group of examiners, and then supervised by professors who are experts in the subject, and the grading of exams is also done by the professors who are responsible for the subject. This way can to a certain extent avoid the situation of repeated questions.
However, it is necessary to design a test that is in accordance with the actual situation of teaching and learning. The difficulty of the test should be distributed in accordance with the overall situation of students' learning, and the difficulty should be distributed in accordance with the normal distribution. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the situation of teaching and learning, and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so as to make the examination of the test in accordance with the difficulty of the test and the type of the test. At the same time, it is necessary to design the test in accordance with the innovation of the test type.
Exams are the conductor's baton for university education, and what kind of exams students take will determine the corresponding preparation plan. In the long run, it will affect the effect of university education.
For the recommendation letters, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it, and has issued a rectification plan for the whole school.
It is necessary to organize teachers to carry out research and course closure examination self-inspection, formulate examination test papers and relevant regulations, and at the same time strengthen supervision and inspection of examination test paper design and examination review. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen supervision and inspection of examination test paper design and examination review, and further refine the assessment of scores. It is also necessary to strengthen the comprehensive inspection of all aspects of course teaching.
Solving the problems of monotonous test types, repeated test questions, etc. is a problem that university entrance examination needs to face. Of course, corresponding measures need to be put in place, but the effort lies in the day-to-day routine. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only need to understand the content of teaching, but also need to understand the learning situation of students. Only when both sides understand each other, the interaction between teaching and learning will be better, and the examination will be more in line with reality, so that "nerds" and "dummies" will get what they deserve.

Ms. Jin's wedding gown photography (South Street branch) is temporarily without a branch.
Before taking photos, we changed the time twice because we didn't arrange the time well. The consultant Lan Lan was very patient and helped us to arrange the time.
Later, I chose a weekend with good weather to shoot.
Goldie's team of advisors, make-up artists and photographers are superb.
That was the first time I did makeup professionally, wow - I can't believe I'm going to look that good one day, hahaha.

The outdoor scenes were shot in Jinggang City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, so I didn't feel cold. The makeup artist was constantly paying attention to our clothes and hair accessories. If there was anything wrong, he would immediately help us fix it.
The photographer is also very funny, and by the end of the day, he felt very happy.
During the selection of photos, because I saw a lot of cases on the Internet, I didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we selected photos, we really didn't want to add any photos, and directly added the 24 photos in the meal package, and there was no addition (I heard that my cousin who took the wedding photos at the same time added more than 10,000 photos to the meal package, and I was shocked when I heard it, and I was also afraid that I would add too many photos).
Today, the photos were fixed, Lan Lan sent them to me, and I saw that there were two photos that were not very good, and they immediately helped me to fix them.
Compared with my sister's photos before, I feel that our photos are very satisfactory. It is simple and fresh, which is exactly what I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go for a wedding photo shoot with the Empress Dowager of Xi'an!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth certificates due to counterfeit paper
The Registrar's Department of Sabah said that due to the shortage of anti-forgery paper, it was not possible to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October. To date, the number of people affected has reached 3,200.
However, the agency's chief, Kajuru Aminu, assured that all babies who had applied for birth certificates had their information recorded in the system and that certificates would be issued once the anti-forgery papers were delivered next week.
He addressed the issue at a press conference, explaining that the newspaper had been reporting on the issue for 10 months.
He said the issue had cropped up two months ago, and Malaysia was also facing the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturer of special anti-forgery paper was affected by the epidemic and delayed to reach China.
He explained that the paper used in Sabah newspapers is different from those used in other states, so it cannot be borrowed from other states' stocks.
The latest batch of anti-forgery paper was delivered to Kuala Lumpur on June 6, and was handed over to the printing company on June 8 for part of the printing work.
The agency will dispatch people to Kota Kinabalu next week to collect the goods, and return to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it will take two days (December 20) to hand over the application to the applicant.
We will inform the applicants to go to the local bureau to collect the report form.
He added that this year to date, Sabah has issued 24,801 copies of the birth certificate.
From 7:30 a.m. until now.
Isn't it about time?
I'm talking about food.
I was waiting at #PRS_ORG# across the street.
Good, thank you, because the restaurant said it was ready.

The planned number of students admitted to secondary schools was 380. The proportion of students admitted to secondary schools was less than 10% of the total number of students admitted to secondary schools in the district.
Students with athletic, artistic, and scientific talents and who have registered online are eligible to participate in the special talent enrollment examination.
To facilitate students' convenient participation in the examination, the East City District continued the examination arrangement method of last year, and set up 1-2 examination points in each school district, totaling 13 examination points.
The examination points are divided into examination rooms according to the examination regions, and the examination time is divided into time periods, and the students will enter the examination points in different examination regions in different examination rooms according to the time periods on the day of the examination.

Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee Chairman: Believe that China has the ability to hold a good Olympic Games in special period - New China
Xinhua News Agency Sarajevo on December 11th reported that the President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee Kvesic said that the Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games and believes that China has the ability to organize the Beijing Winter Olympic Games in a special period.
Recently, Chinese Ambassador Ji Ping met with the President of the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo Olympic Center.
During the meeting, Kvesic positively evaluated the relations between the two countries and said that he had visited China in 2008 when the Beijing Olympic Games were held, and he was deeply impressed by China's excellent organization work. He believed that China had the ability to hold a good Winter Olympic Games in the special period; the Polish Olympic Committee was looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games; and the Polish Olympic Committee was actively organizing participation in the Beijing Winter Olympic Games. The Polish Olympic Committee hoped to use this as an opportunity to expand the exchange and cooperation between the two countries in the field of sports.
Qian Ping said that China and Poland have a special "Olympic corridor".
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympic Games were successfully held here. Two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games will open its curtains, presenting a simple, safe and spectacular event to the world.
We look forward to deepen exchanges and cooperation in the preparation of winter sports events, training of athletes, and other aspects. The Chinese Embassy in Belgrade will continue to play a bridge-building role, and we wish to take advantage of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games to further deepen humanitarian exchanges between the two countries, so that the people of the two countries can “move forward together”. We also wish that the athletes from Belarus will achieve good results in Beijing.
Prior to the meeting, the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina held a ceremony to award the "Best Athlete of the Year 2010" award, and Cui Ping was invited as a special guest to award the best young athlete in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
A video promoting the Beijing Winter Olympic Games was played in a loop at the scene of the event.
I'm disappointed.

48 hours nucleic acid negative, set "buffer zone" the State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a notice to strengthen the prevention and control of epidemic in port cities - New China
China News Service, Beijing, December 11, 2021 (reporters Dong Rui Feng and Guo Tiancheng) The National Defense and Epidemic Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic prevention and control work at the border ports. It requires that people who leave the land border ports (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) within the next 48 hours must have a negative nucleic acid test certificate, and those who arrive at the land border ports must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the port cities of the provinces, municipalities and regions and announcing it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that conditional port cities can study setting up quarantine buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
The State Health and Family Planning Commission Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Office said that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and the frequency of cross-border people to and fro is frequent.
Implementing differentiated management policies, from one defensive line to two defensive lines, which is expected to achieve the goal of moving the front line forward, compressing the risk of spreading the epidemic, and achieving the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the smallest social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, domestic outbreaks of cluster infections have occurred frequently, and all of them are imported from overseas via port cities.
The above notice pointed out that some places monitored the epidemic in a timely manner, the high-risk personnel closed-loop management was not implemented, the regular nucleic acid detection was formalistic, the cold chain products were insufficient in each link, the epidemic emergency response was insufficient, and the management of concentrated isolation facilities was not standardized, and the epidemic emergency response was not scientific and accurate.
It is required to focus on strengthening the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in the port city, improving the epidemic monitoring and warning system, implementing border management measures, and strengthening the shortcomings and weak points in the port city epidemic prevention and control. We must not let our guard down, and do scientific and accurate epidemic prevention and control work.
The notice stressed that all port cities should study and implement the epidemic prevention and the people’s livelihood protection work at the same time, publish and facilitate the people’s livelihood protection hotline, and periodically check the supply of basic living necessities and prices, and timely solve and proactively respond to the prominent problems.
According to the notice, the cities included in the open land, water, and air ports are the counties (cities, districts, and banners) of the open land, water, and air ports, the cities (regions, prefectures, and self-governing municipalities) of the open land, water, and air ports, and the self-governing municipalities of the open land, water, and air ports. The specific scope will be determined by each province (autonomous region, direct-governed municipality) according to the epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in time.

Oil pipeline video reveals U.S. military's 20-year bloodthirsty killing spree - New China
(Video source: Oil Pipeline).
On December 11, the oil pipeline platform released a micro documentary called "Murder Machine" that attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the U.S. invading Afghanistan under the guise of "anti-terrorism" to impose American-style democracy through the war. Over the course of 20 years, the U.S. forces have committed countless crimes against humanity.
Using drones to bomb hospitals, schools, and other civilian sites, perverting human nature, and forming a killing squad.
Over the past 20 years, U.S. forces have killed thousands of Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up "black sites" to subject detainees to various forms of torture and humiliation.
One atrocity after another is fueling more Afghans' hatred of the Taliban.
As the video says, the American "anti-terrorism" war is "more anti-terrorism".
War has not brought peace, prosperity and democracy to the Afghan people, but only misery and destruction.
Share the video with us to reveal the truth of the United States using "anti-terrorism" as an excuse for bloodthirsty killings, and reveal the false face of American-style democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article from a business perspective and from the perspective of the storage period. It discusses why this customer wants to let the logistics company in the bonded zone do the canned packaging, although the canned packaging is a deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company, but the following article may be able to explain why the customer wants to do so.
I went to many dairy factories and saw many dairy production lines.
In fact, the bags of powdered milk and the cans of powdered milk have the same raw materials, and there is no difference between them.
So, naturally, people will ask: Why is the shelf-life of the bagged product one year, while the shelf-life of the vacuum-packed product is two years or longer?
Or another question: Why is the price difference between hearing aid and bag hearing aid so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the expensive one is the good one.
There are also consumers who ate it because of this attitude and said that the taste or flavor of the packaged food was different.
First, let's talk about the reason for the expensive sound. Where is the expensive?
Why are their raw materials so different?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the bagged price is too high, consumers will find it hard to accept, which means that the manufacturer's profit is very low, or no profit at all. So, how can the manufacturer survive?
So they had a very large uplift in their pricing to protect their profit margin.
As a result, most manufacturers are promoting bags rather than cans.
There are so many factories that spend so many advertising fees every year. Where do these fees come from?
You can imagine.
So, as society develops, market promotion fees, such as: promoters in shopping malls, display fees in shopping malls, free gifts for products, advertising fees, etc., will continue to increase.
So, each manufacturer is constantly adding new products, and they are also hearing installations, and their prices are also increasing. In fact, this is new products that are coming out as a result of the increase in market fees.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, their raw materials will not increase more than RMB 3 or RMB 4.
There is also another part of brands, for the purpose of promoting their products, they do not choose any means, they hook up with doctors of hospitals, and they help to promote their products, and they get profits ranging from RMB 30 to RMB 80.
China's relevant laws are absolutely not allowed to operate in this way. In fact, this kind of operation method is harming the consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bag-packed milk powder and put it into cans, which can save money and increase the storage and sealability of the milk powder. It will not have any impact on the baby.
Also, do not think that the shelf life of hearing packaging is longer than that of bag packaging. If the shelf life of hearing packaging is the same as that of bag packaging after opening the bag, it means that bag packaging is not easy to preserve and is prone to spoil.
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and it was cold after it was cold, it was dry and hard, and there was no way to eat it.
And the broth spilled out.
Immediately cancel, their #PRS_ORG# stuff must have cooled down
I didn't get it!
#NAME# said that no one went to get it.
We called them.
If you don't refund me, I'll call the police.
Repeatedly using #PRS_ORG, this time was the worst experience.
Absolutely unacceptable
Yes, you can.
But also to remind restaurants and cyclists.
Avoid a recurrence
I want to know the exact delivery time.
That time keeps on delaying.
I don't know when it's going to happen.
If the order is cancelled, can I get my money back?
How do you pay the service fee to the rider?
A cyclist was confirmed dead more than an hour ago.
I don't want to wait any longer.
Don't scare people into the starting line - New China
Walking around the book market, you can often feel the boom of successful learning books.
Today's self-help books are full of "best principles" - i.e. assuming or implying that you can "do it" and then telling you what to do.
It is equivalent to saying that we have skipped over the "how to do it" part, which is in fact the most important and fundamental part.
Because of this, these books all have a common feature - they either go all out to achieve the best, or they don't bother to do anything at all; they either go to 100, or they go to zero; they either climb the mountain, or they stay where they are.
This "best principle" makes it so that whoever looks at it will agree that it is "absolutely correct," but 99% of people will be scared off at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make a 180-degree turnaround and become a new person," which is the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who adhere to established customs, insist on adhering to old customs, and refuse to accept change, you are bound to shout at him, "You need to change", which is undoubtedly self-deceit and deceiving the ox.
Most people will be intimidated by the word "change" and will not dare to move forward, and they will be unable to make a decision; or they will make a rash decision based on a momentary impulse, and then they will be brave enough to take the first step, but they often fail to maintain it for a long time.
Master Ma Sanli's famous "From Tomorrow," which is the classic expression of this "universal human nature," is well known.
The "best principle" has the biggest problem in that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "wonder at the door and sigh".
Perhaps, the "second good principle" is a path that can lead more ordinary people to relative success.
The core of the "next best principle" is that "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories" - that is, if you don't get to 100, it's okay to get to 1; because 1 is always greater than 0; if you don't climb to the top of the mountain, it's okay to climb up to your front yard's small sandhill.
In general, it's better to do something than not to do anything.
The lowering of the threshold has made it easier for ordinary people to persevere, and the success rate will increase as long as they persevere.
Following the "second-best principle," the path to success is somewhat longer.
In summary, the "best principle" although on the surface it is under the banner of making everyone successful, in the end, it can only motivate a few; while the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people, as much as possible to make more people benefit.

The stock of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 tons this year - New China
Xining, December 11 (China Newswire) (Reporters Liu Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) The reporters learned from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the stock of Naked Trout resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 tons compared to the previous year, reaching 10.85 tons, which is 40 times more than the initial protection in 2002.
The naked carp, also known as "Tibetan carp", is a rare fish species in Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological chain of "water-fish-bird" in the Qinghai Lake watershed, and it plays an important role in maintaining the ecological chain of "water-fish-bird" in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 70s of the 20th century, due to the large-scale catching and breeding of fish in the degraded ecological environment, the number of Yellow River carp decreased sharply. In 2002, the stock of Yellow River carp was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Chinese Species Red List listed the greenback trout as an endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of the lake and the breeding of fish. It prohibits any organization, group, and individual from fishing for carp in Qinghai Lake and its major rivers and tributaries. It prohibits the sale of carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial spawning release and cleaning of the main inflow channels of the major tributaries of Qaidam Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable “fish passages” and other measures to continuously increase the protection strength, the number of Qaidam Lake carp resources is increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Areas of Qinghai Province, introduced that, as of now, more than 1.8 million juveniles have been artificially spawned and released into Lake Qinghai, which accounts for more than 23% of the contribution to the restoration of Lake Qinghai carp resources.
The Three-River-Source Region of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source replenishment area in China and even in Asia. The Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three-River-Source Region and the Qinghai Lake water area, and to protect the aquatic wildlife, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai first issued the ban on fishing in the Long River, the Yellow River, and the Qinghai Lake key water areas, and built up the “One River, One River, One Lake” comprehensive ban on fishing management system.
I used my #PRS_ORG# RED credit card to spend more than $180 on food.
But there was no deduction of $20.

The restaurant only gave me one bag, and I had to put it into the bag, the weather was cold
Is the delivery in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I want to know if we lost it or someone took it away, thanks.
It's been over an hour and they still haven't sent it
I just read an article that was too long.
Give this to the men who don't know.
Most girls experience their first period between the ages of 13 and 15, and reach menopause around the age of 50.
As long as your body is healthy, you will come once a month on a regular basis.
But it's also not precise enough to be able to accurately predict, with a tolerance of about a week or so, you need to be prepared in advance, and sometimes bad luck can also lead to a rollover (suddenly a few days ahead of schedule).
The length of time, the amount of blood loss, and the severity of the pain varies from person to person. Some people take three days, some take a week; some people have little bleeding, and some have a lot of bleeding. Some people have no reaction, and some people are in pain to the point of needing an ambulance. The severity of the pain changes with time, and what used to not hurt doesn't mean it won't hurt forever.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and it starts from the beginning to the end of a few days and flows blood for 24 hours. The only thing one can do is to use sanitary napkins or sanitary tampons to prevent the blood from flowing to the clothes or chairs.
Menstrual pain is mainly due to the secretion of progesterone, which is effective in relieving the pain in the first few days of the menstrual period. However, it is ineffective after the menstrual pain has started.
During the pre-menstrual period, the uterus is filled with blood and excess progesterone is released, which makes it easy to have abdominal pain.
If it's about that time, you'll get a stomach ache for no reason, and you'll come your period in about two days.
It is best to change two or three times in two to three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Besides sleeping time, the worst case is to change 6 times a day, every month for 7 days, which is 42 pieces. If you prepare early, it may be 50 pieces.
Change the sanitary napkins every 5 to 6 hours (at most 8 hours), and the sanitary napkins do not need to be changed frequently.
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) released during the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive, and the hormonal changes during ovulation may cause mood swings and make you feel unlucky.
However, the official crime rate data can show that women's ability to control emotions is still quite high, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The flow is not just blood, but also the shedding of the uterine lining.
The endometrium of the uterus is the thinnest after the menstruation, and it becomes thicker gradually, which can be understood as the uterus is like a house, and every month builds a house (the endometrium becomes thicker) to prepare to welcome guests, but there are no guests, so the whole thing is dismantled, and the next month builds a new house again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. It has been going on for several decades, with blood flowing for several days every month, and it also causes abdominal pain and back pain. Who would like it?
However, people can be born because of their mother's menstruation. Menstruation is for preparing you to live in a house for 10 months when you come to this world for the first time. We should thank our mother for having regular menstruation.
Women's many things were suppressed in the past, society brainwashed women to say that they are dirty and shameful, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, feels that women's bodies are making preparations for pregnancy that are disgusting, they shouldn't say it in front of a large crowd. The girls should stand up. They have never experienced it, and they will not experience it in this life. The men should not be so forgetful of their gratitude and their sense of justice. This attitude is not good for facing one's mother. It is not good for thinking about one's child.
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary napkins. They are really good.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and sending the wrong thing makes people disappointed.
You have to order extra food for the kids to eat.
I hope that in the midst of the hustle and bustle of the shop, you will check the goods.
Is the hot tub causing a tingling sensation in my feet?
Choosing an appropriate foot bath basin can have a very good therapeutic effect, and today, Guomeng’s editor will answer this question. We hope that it will be helpful to our friends.
As people's awareness of health improves, the popularity of foot bath basins has increased, and a large number of products with different grades have emerged in the market, from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices.
Foot bath tubs and other health appliances are selling like hotcakes, but there is no specific industry standard for these appliances, so there is a certain safety hazard.
Having your feet immersed in live electricity is really dangerous, isn't it?"
Mr Li told the reporter that he bought a footbath basin for his father as a gift for his birthday, but his father felt his feet were numb.
Mr Li initially thought that it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt the tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li used the electric pen to test it, and the electric pen lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot tub was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, although he returned the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.
Because he found that this well-established foot bath was set at the highest temperature, suitable for any group of people, and made of what kind of material, there was no clear and detailed industry regulation.
However, in general, foot bath basins do not have a problem of electric leakage. However, it is not ruled out that a small number of products leave the factory without strict inspection.
Therefore, when you are buying a footbath, choose a separate footbath basin.
Water and electricity are separated, with no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take any pencil to test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Exhibition Opened - Viewpoint Headlines - The Hunan Daily Newspaper - HuaChangOnline
The Hunan Daily News reported on December 10 that the 13th Hunan Tea Exhibition and the New Huali Red Tea Promotion Meeting was held at the Hunan International Exhibition Center. The event showcased the tea industry, innovated tea science, promoted tea culture, and accelerated the goal of 1 trillion tea industry.
Hu Shengli, Vice President of the National Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and Yi Hong, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Liu Zhenghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand introduction at the opening ceremony: the source of the lake red is in the new Hubei, and the red tea is rising as the “five-color Hubei tea”.
In recent years, the provincial committee and provincial government have actively supported the development of tea industry. They have promoted the construction of a trillion-yuan tea industry and formed the development pattern of “Three Sichuan, Four Waters and Five Colors of Tea”.
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea, and other main tea types alternating, and the main tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, with the aim of increasing the income of tea farmers.
Feng Shui is cyclical, and Red Tea is gaining momentum.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after picking green tea, they would pick red tea and black tea, and tea farmers would have income all year round. The value of tea plantations would rise straight up.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders presented the “Hunan Red Tea” trademark to the enterprises that were granted the right to use the trademark for the fourth time.
In the New Huali Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants saw a tea called "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Xiaogao, secretary of the Tea Industry Association, was happy to say that the current epidemic and other factors or more or less affect the tea market, but from the scene of the Tea Exhibition, the highlights are abundant.
The new Huzhou red tea has a hint of red, infused with the tea culture, people are lively, trade is hot, and the Huzhou tea industry is looking forward to a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?
I don't want it, because there's nowhere to park down here," he said.
Philosophy is the study of problems that cannot be directly answered by the senses.
Metaphysics is the basic principle of philosophy, aimed at explaining the basic properties of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation title "Metaphysics" comes from the phrase "The form above is called the Way, the form below is called the Instrument" in the Yi Jing Shi Chuan Shi. It was coined by the Japanese person Ishiya Tetsurou (during the Meiji era) by translating Metaphysics.
The branch of metaphysics includes body theory, natural theology, and its extensions.
The body-thing thesis is "the study of what terms represent genuine existence entities, and what terms merely represent a concept."
Naturalism, which denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis assumes that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural causes, by philosophers who support science and evolution.
The method of naturalism, on the other hand, is the study of God without qualification.
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of consciousness and its relation to the body (especially the brain).
Two-ism and One-ism are the two main schools of thought on the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origins, and scope of knowledge.
Moral philosophy is a systematic study and research of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the norms accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into ethical theory (abstractly studying the essence of ethics or ethical criticism) and ethical standard (judging various different moral views, and providing ethical standards for correct or incorrect behavior.
It studies what people should follow in terms of ethical standards), applied ethics (the application of ethics to real-life situations, including biological ethics, political ethics, etc.), and ethical description (the collection of information about how people live).
It is not an examination of moral theory from the perspective of pre-supposition, but an investigation of the actual moral agents (moral agents) who make decisions and are observed, and all the moral factors of this decision. It is an examination of the morals held by social and ethnic groups.
The history of ethics includes the Greek and Roman ethics, and the Christian ethics of the Middle Ages.
The first part is the humanistic ethical thought represented by Vala and Monet, etc.
The second part is the ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
The third part is the political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, the modern ethics (17-18th century, the British experienceist ethics, represented by Hobbes and others, the European rationalism ethics (18th century, the French Enlightenment ethics, represented by Voltaire and others, the German Institute ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel, the British utilitarian ethics, represented by Bentham and Huxley, the British evolutionist ethics, represented by Darwin and Huxley, the German neo-Kantianism ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green and others, the German neo-Hegelianism ethics, represented by Nietzsche and others, the transition period ethics (non-rationalist ethics, represented by C. G. Jung and others), and the transition period ethics (non-rationalist ethics, represented by C. G. Jung and others).
Logic is the study of the principles and standards of effectiveness and proof.
Logic typically consists of three parts: inductive logic, deductive logic, and abductive logic, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the essence and meaning of beauty.

Ding Zilin: Dear friends.
This person sincerely thanks all friends for their humanitarian aid during the 30-odd years since our relatives met with misfortune. Particularly, since I issued a call for humanitarian aid in my name in 1994, I have never stopped my humanitarian aid.
Most of the victims' elderly parents have passed away, and orphans have grown up.
It was your generosity that helped us get through the most difficult times.
The coronavirus pandemic is wreaking havoc across the globe, and most of the donors are retirees.
For this reason, I earnestly request you to stop the donations to us from the group of mothers of Tiananmen Square, this humanitarian aid activity should have long ago come to an end.
I will always remember your love, and believe that your deeds will be recorded in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my intention in this way, and I hope my friends will understand.
Please accept my heartfelt wishes.
Tao Yiru: I would like to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the history of humanitarian aid undertaken by the International Federation of Catholic Schools (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation (MCDF) for 32 years.
During the process of conducting humanitarian assistance, the All-American Students' Union and the Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation are parallel organizations, and the project implementors often cross each other.
The mother of Tiananmen Square was responsible for the Tiananmenmother.com website, which was managed by Tao Yiru. pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Aid money often fails to reach the hands of the Six-Four victims.
In 1994, under the suggestion of Master Ding, the "Mother of Tiananmen Square" established a special group to coordinate and take charge of the collection and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "Education Fund for Orphans of the June 4th Incident", which was implemented for 11 years. In 2009, when all the orphans of the June 4th incident had graduated from university, the MCDF established the "Education Fund for Orphans of the June 4th Incident with Old and Poor People", and it has been implemented until now.
The money for these projects comes mainly from donations made during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, as well as individual donations, and is supported by the Brother's University Democracy Fund.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Rehabilitation Research Foundation.
It was not until last year that the Tiananmen Square survivors finally received a portion of the donation collected in the name of Tiananmen Square in Hong Kong 31 years ago.
During this period, China Human Rights also carried out its humanitarian assistance projects independently.
We understand that Professor Ding stopped the fundraising for the June 4th incident, and it was for the consideration of the donors. We are also some retirees, and our income is not as rich as before retirement. Therefore, we express our gratitude to Professor Ding for his "letter to a friend".
We will respect your decision to end this project within two years, and will resume it when needed.
I express my gratitude and respect to those who have been consistent in their generosity and have risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid.

Thanks to the rabbit's review. Originally, I said that the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thanks to Dan Dan's recognition, we can continue to move forward with full energy. We will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great! I strongly recommend everyone to come!
Whether it is the reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography, or post-production, there is nothing to complain about.
The makeup artist is particularly meticulous, and will customize your makeup according to your style. The makeup products used are also from the top brands.
Tian Liang, the photographer, is even more professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two cute kittens to play with.
We are working in Beijing, and the good photo studios in Beijing need to queue up half a year in advance. My colleague has taken photos in Beijing, and he thought the photos were just so so.
I specifically searched for this studio, a place with a soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, and we think that this is the short version of most people. The photographer Liang Ge will take pictures and record the natural and brilliant moment.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production, a great team.

If you are planning to start a career in this field, you can choose to go to a place for training. However, if you don't have this kind of intention, it is better to self-study. After all, the cost of training is very high, and it takes 6 months to study.
However, if you are planning to dive into this industry, training is a very good choice, especially for those with low self-confidence and weak people.
If you have a strong self-learning ability, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more exhausting.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First, we need to look at the strength of this institution's faculty. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, then this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have strong faculty strength.
Secondly, before choosing, it is necessary to inquire about this training institution. The best way is to inquire about the students of this training institution, because only the students of the training institution know how the training institution is.
Hello, actually, I don't know how to answer your question, because I don't know your situation, and I don't know how to answer your question.
For example, professions, age, languages you want to learn, and where you want to live are all related to the field you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer major who has already graduated, I recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective. Now many offline and online training institutions are very good. However, the learning cost is high and the investment time is relatively long. Generally, you need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months.
However, if what I said is the case, self-learning is very convenient. There are a lot of free learning resources on the Internet now, and there are also a lot of training resources on B站. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed inquiries.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with videos to learn.
If you are not a computer major, but you can pay a certain amount of learning fees and time cost, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way of learning will not be too exhausting, the teacher will explain in detail, and there will be someone to answer your questions. In addition, there will be help in planning and supervision.
In addition, many training institutions have signed employment agreements, with internal recommendations, and students can be recommended to companies after studying. This way, the interview process for finding a job can also be shortened.
The above is my understanding of the matter. If you have other inquiries, you can contact me at any time.
I said 10 minutes ago, I saw it in the app
What is it called?
I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?

Thanks to those who silently gave me a thumbs up, I will continue to work hard for life
Life will not betray anyone who works hard, so follow me, thank those who silently give me a like.
Life is like this. Others only look at the results, but I have to support the process by myself. In front of life, we have to be strong and continue. There is no choice but to go on. The road can look back, but you cannot go back.
Cleaning is a job, but also a responsibility, life is beautiful because of service, service is brilliant because of sincerity.
Although we are doing the dirtiest job, we will use the most sincere attitude to clean every corner of the customer's house. When we see the satisfied smiles of the customers and the raised thumbs, all the exhaustion will be worth it.
My day-to-day work
——Your request, my service.
Serve with heart, clean with heart, keep the beautiful.
The details that you care about, the Fenggu Family Service is able to do "clean" what I can do, and provide service to love your home.

Crystal lamps are beautiful, but if they are not cleaned for a long time, they will lose their luster. Only when they are cleaned can they shine brightly. Life is also like this.
It is only with sincerity that we can achieve success, and it is only with meticulousness that we can shape an exquisite work. We are sincere.
Give me a chance, I will make you satisfied, quality proves everything, because professional deserves to be trusted, your recognition is my encouragement!
It's hard to make a living in every field right now.
But I still believe that, as long as I am sincere, I will be better than others, at least I will be better than those who sit and complain."
A day's work begins with the morning, all the good things begin with the dawn. Wish you carry happiness, good luck, health and well-being to start a new day, keep a good mood all day long. Good morning
When I was a child, happiness was a thing; having it made me happy; as I grew older, happiness was a goal; achieving it made me happy; and, as I matured, I realized that happiness was a state of mind; understanding it made me happy.
To be the most authentic and the most benevolent self, to act according to one's heart, without regrets in this life; to walk one's own path; to have two treasures in life: a good body and a good mood, to shine brightly until old age.
At every stage of life, we face different challenges.
Oftentimes, it's not the ability that binds you, but the courage to face it.
Since you can't avoid it, you might as well face it.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be defeated by difficulties; if you dare to meet difficulties and overcome them, problems will finally be solved.
China and Saudi Arabia Jointly Present the First Contemporary Art Exhibition in Saudi Arabia - New China
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou) The first contemporary art exhibition in Saudi Arabia - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale was officially opened to the public on December 11 in the northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries participated in the exhibition.
This biannual exhibition was jointly planned by the Saadiriya Foundation for Biennial Exhibitions and the UCCA Yuyuan Contemporary Art Center in China. UCCA Yuyuan Contemporary Art Center Director Tian Yuwu was in charge of artistic supervision.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Touching the Stone to Cross the River", which symbolizes the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabian social and cultural development.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with exhibition halls stretching across six connected buildings. Six units are presented: Touching the Stone to Cross the River, Preserving as an Experiment, The Periphery of Thought, Walking to the Public, Beautiful New World, and On the Spirit of Art.
Among the 27 artists from Saudi Arabia, their works accounted for more than four fifths of the total number of exhibits, including paintings, installations, and performances. Twelve artists from China also attracted attention. Some artists used recycled materials to create their works. For example, Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting in “The Story Behind the Mountains of Infinity” (2014).
Bakley, the chief executive officer of the Dhahab Foundation, said he hoped the biennial exhibition would establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences to learn about the cultural industries and creative communities of Saudi Arabia.
Tian Yuwu said, "The goal of the biennial exhibition is dual. It not only allows Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, but also allows the Saudi audience to integrate into the contemporary art world. "
During the two-year exhibition period, a series of lectures will also be held. Artists, curators and leaders of the creative industry will discuss topics such as intercultural exchanges, contemporary art development, etc.

Yunnan: Coordinating and Regulating the Management of Public Benefit Positions in Rural Areas - New China
Xinhua News Agency Kunming, December 12, 2020 (reporter Lin Bifeng). To continue to do well in employment assistance for poverty people, consolidate and expand poverty alleviation achievements, Yunnan Province recently issued a series of policies to promote rural revitalization, to help promote all-round rural revitalization.
According to the person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Welfare, at present, Yunnan has developed 44.83 thousand rural public-benefit jobs, which are used to employ the poverty-stricken labor force and other rural poor groups. It plays an important role in helping the poverty-stricken groups to realize employment and increase their income, consolidate the poverty-stricken achievements, and effectively improve the rural public services.
This new regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan People's Society, Rural Revitalization, Finance, and other seven departments. It mainly unified the scope of the object of recruiting public-benefit positions in the grassroots, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions.
In terms of job placement, the new regulations are clear that job placement should be based on the principle of “need-based job placement, job placement based on people, dynamic management, total quantity control”, “who develops, who uses, and who is responsible”, and “one person, one job, voluntary public announcement, and unified management”.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the announcement, application, examination, approval, publicity, employment, and on-the-job training and arrangement.
In addition, the new regulation also clearly stipulates the specific duties of the main development agencies of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts, and stipulates that the relevant agencies should purchase accident insurance for the placement of rural public welfare posts. It also stipulates that the relevant agencies should periodically monitor the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare posts.

2. Although the right-wing has had a golden age in history, it is not long, so it is short because it is illuminated by a little sunlight, and it sweats a little when it drinks a little water. When the right-wing is a little proud, it will be beaten.
But in reality, right-wingers have played a positive role in the social progress.
The positive significance of the rightist cannot be denied from the conclusion of the end of the Cultural Revolution, the development of the economy, the improvement of science and technology, and the promotion of administrative system and human rights protection.
Three, as for me, although I do not completely agree with Li Wei Dong's some sayings, but I am very concerned about his sayings, and I also respect Li Wei Dong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincere about China's social problems.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, I think that revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, people's livelihood will be affected, political parties will be muddled, and foreign countries will take advantage of the opportunity to invade.
Fourth, change or improve China must have patience and bear the responsibility for the country and the people. Political machinations aimed at profiting from the fire will not be right-wing, but are scoundrels.
Let's talk about the left.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of orphans of time and politics.
If the right has a positive impact on society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing views and analyses of their thoughts at the right time. However, the left has no such effect, because the left wants to throw away what the Communist Party has discarded!
Fifthly, I recently saw some friends scolding the thieves and refuting them, and they were quite energetic. I think this is not necessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors and lunatics. They're just one string of nerves, and there's no point in trying to reason with them.
And don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the traitors and lunatics admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: when robbers insult you for five cents, and when left-wingers insult you as right-wingers, it proves that our middle road is correct!
Many people had ideals when they were young, but when they grew older, they forgot their ideals, or pursued ideals, but became stubborn.
And as the ideal receded, it became more and more distant, even to the point where the dragon-slaying youth became a dragon himself.
I feel that generally it refers to constraints and freedoms, and China is biased to the left historically and culturally.
Right-wingers in China focus on efficiency and development, while left-wingers emphasize supervision and pay more attention to fairness and safety.
At present, society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, the competition between China and the United States is inevitable, and it is certain that it will continue for a long time.
Even though I don't understand it, I'll give it a thumbs up.
There's no point in saying anything else. Flower Flower is just that kind of person.
Over the past two years, the U.S. has blocked and encircled Huawei’s chips, which not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused “U.S. companies” to suffer huge losses.
The U.S. and its allies imposed sanctions on China's semiconductor industry, requiring their own companies and allied countries to simultaneously block China's semiconductor industry, which directly led to the disruption of global semiconductor supply chains. As a result, semiconductor production companies' research and development investment decreased, and their production capacity decreased, which led to a shortage of semiconductors in the global semiconductor supply chain.
Today, the shortage of semiconductors has affected all major industries in the world, including car manufacturers, smartphone price hikes, and almost all industries that use semiconductors.
To gain control over the "chip" sovereignty, more and more countries' technology giants began to take the road of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control power and suppress the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has been acting frequently recently. It also invited 64 major countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and provided subsidies to support American domestic technology giants, such as Intel, the United States' old-established semiconductor technology giant. In order to regain its leading position in the semiconductor field, the United States invested 20 billion US dollars to build two semiconductor manufacturing factories in Yavisiana, Arizona, and opened semiconductor wafer processing business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's action will cause a certain impact on TSMC, and it is very likely to take away TSMC's "plate".
The reason for being so confident is that Intel, as an old technology giant in the United States, has been cultivating in the semiconductor field for dozens of years, and has a large number of talents and technical reserves. It must be able to quickly rise up and defeat TSMC in a short period of time.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC's founder, Zhang Zhongtong, did not care.
At the "2021 Master's Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongwu's words were shocking. He said that Intel's investment to build a semiconductor foundry is equivalent to a slap in the face.
Zhang Zhongwu's disdain for Intel's entry into the semiconductor field is due to the fact that Zhang Zhongwu still remembers the grudges between Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel of the American manufacturing industry, occupying the highest position in the world semiconductor industry.
In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were controlled by a small number of strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip from design, manufacturing to packaging was completed by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this kind of model makes some small enterprises unable to bear the burden, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face huge construction fees for production lines.
Inspired by the market demand, after entering the 80s, the semiconductor industry began to see the phenomenon of division of labor cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company that specialized in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company that specialized in chip design, it would be possible to establish a factory that specialized in wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongwu's idea became reality, and TSMC was born.
Taiwan Semiconductor focuses its main business on "wafer fabrication" and does not engage in chip design. It only provides semiconductor wafer fabrication services.
Taiwan Semiconductor, which was just established at that time, was just a small fry in front of Intel.
To obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongtong once approached Intel for investment. However, when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing process of semiconductors, they were somewhat conceited and looked down on TSMC, so they refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also acknowledged that Intel at the time did not hold a high opinion of wafer fabrication services.
No one could have imagined that the behemoths of wafer manufacturing services would also have to start making wafers.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmiao felt that Intel's entry into the semiconductor foundry was very embarrassing.
Taiwan Semiconductor's market value has already surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's aggressive attack, Intel naturally cannot afford to be complacent.
Taiwans semiconductor industry is now aiming for 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm.
It's not easy to catch up.
I can't wait.

Today, let's take a look at some of the "weird" trending topics.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Raised its Head, Goodli Friend Raised its Prices, and the Cargo拉拉事件, and the spread of public opinion formed a peak, and then [the index decreased] (smooth curve) finally dissipated. If there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small hump.
They look very similar to the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" displayed on the official website of the State Internet Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches for the same event, and present "isolated peaks", "sawtooth peaks", and "sheer cliffs".
“Isolated Peak” refers to the artificial heating, which rushed to the hot search, attracting the attention of the general public; “Sawtooth” refers to the periodic heating, which ensures that the hot search stays on the hot search list; “Broken Cliff” refers to the collective withdrawal, and the hot search has played its “role” and has received a new task, and has moved to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the intensity peak of one event coincides with the trough of another event, and the time difference is only a few seconds, so it must be the same batch of water army that received the task and started a new round of attack.
The professionalization of Black Public Relations can be seen at a glance: dozens of hot searches at the same time, what attracts attention, what is responsible for public education, what causes a war, what shifts attention, what affects cognition, what misleads judgments, what provokes emotions, what influences decision-making, and what stimulates emotions. The Black Public Relations accounts are divided into batches and at different points of time. Almost all aspects are considered in the dissemination of public opinion.
It is a science of dissemination. Disregarding subjective factors such as attitudes and emotions, only objective data can escape the influence of black propaganda.
Anyone who passes by will leave a mark, and we will dig up those marks together.

Mauritius and other countries discover omicron variant infected cases for the first time - New China
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: According to reports from foreign correspondents of Xinhua News Agency, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi reported for the first time that the new coronavirus variant Omicron infected cases.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant on 10th day.
A person infected with the virus arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27, and another person infected with the virus was a resident of Mauritius who had been in contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated and treated at the hospital, the two infected persons' nucleic acid test results turned negative, and they have returned to their respective residences.
Cypriot health authorities announced on 10th day of the month that the first three cases of Omicron variant infection were confirmed in the country.
All three are students who returned from overseas travel in early this month. They are all mild cases and have not been hospitalized.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the Senegalese government has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10, all passengers aged 12 and above entering the country by plane will be required to pay for the nucleic acid test at the airport.
The country's health department announced on the 10th that it would start to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 with Pfizer's new coronavirus vaccine.
Malawi's health minister, Khumbati Malamule, said on September 9 that the country had recorded three cases of Omicron variant infection.
The country's health department carried out genome sequencing of the 12 new coronavirus positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found these three cases of infection.

Damei 360 integrated home decoration
Address: No. 156, Huancheng Nanyi Road, 12th floor of Happiness Garden.
At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look at the initial budget of 70,000 yuan to do a basic renovation.
The scam begins as soon as you walk into the store.
I went to the shop for the first time just to show them my floor plan, and they didn't go to the site to measure the house. They were able to give me a quotation of RMB 700,000 for my 135 square meter house. I didn't know what kind of materials they used.
Their second trick is to make you pay a deposit (which you will never be able to get back, unless you have enough experience to deal with them) as soon as you walk in the door.
When I was hesitating whether or not to pay a deposit, they would invite their alleged manager to tell you that you will get a discount if you pay the deposit.
This is a big hole, I was fooled into paying a deposit of RMB 10,000.
He gave me a price of $70,000 that did not include water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors or cabinets, and did not include any bathroom, but these three things are the biggest cost of basic installation.
In addition to these, their service fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company, and they didn't explain anything to me at the beginning, and made me sign a contract.
When I went to get my money back, they acted like they were very experienced, with a special little team to deal with you.
Whatever the circumstances, the customer is always to blame.
There are various shifting of responsibilities, as well as a lot of details, I don't want to say them one by one because it is tears, in general, don't choose them because my friend found them to renovate his house and the quality is not good, and he will charge you for all kinds of fees.
It's a scam, they're just the decorated dragon heads that used to deceive people, and now they've changed into something else.
So don't choose this kind of decoration company.
In the future, everyone should pay attention to these consultations because the renovation is not a small amount of money.
To ask a merchant a question, you must first log in or register.
It is strictly forbidden to publish all kinds of merchant reviews. For more details, please refer to the merchant listing disclaimer.
People's review of Kunming decoration design channel provides you with the address, telephone, business hours, etc. of the latest merchant information. If you want to find a decoration company, you can go to People's review of Kunming decoration design channel.
This is so scary, if you don't cancel your order within 30 minutes, please cancel your order!
Is there no other way? Like, changing the address?
Okay, don't cancel the conversation if you don't pay me within 5 to 10 days. I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel in 15 minutes or so.
The chicken should be cooked, but I received the raw meat, so I can't eat it.
Starry Sky Has an Appointment: Gemini Meteor Shower on the 14th with the Greatest-New China
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (reporter Zhou Ruihe). Astronomy popularization experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, which is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. The Gemini meteor shower can be observed after midnight on December 14th.
A Beijing amateur astronomer, An Gu, captured the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2018, in Qinghai.
Most of the meteors in the Gemini shower are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini shower is the 3200 Phaethon asteroid, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini stream of meteors is also the second known meteor stream that is not associated with a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society Council Member and Astronomy Popularization Expert Zhu Liangpeng introduced that the Taurus Meteor Shower would appear at the end of the year, and the "showing period" could last from December 4th to December 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its abundance and steadiness. It is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, together with the Geminid meteor shower and the Leonid meteor shower.
One of the distinctive features of the Gemini meteor shower is that the speed of the meteors is slow, the colors are rich, and the fireballs are not few. It is suitable for both amateur astronomers and amateur photographers.
Yang Yi, an amateur astronomer in Tianjin, captured the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2020, in Tianjin Yizhou.
According to the astronomical forecast, the Gemini meteor shower will peak at 12/14 at around 15:00, with a maximum ZHR of 150.
The Gemini Meteor Shower Recommendation Graph.
Last year, the Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be affected by the moonlight, and the brilliance will be slightly reduced.
On the 14th, the 11th day of the lunar calendar, the moon was in the full moon phase, and the bright moonlight would interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon would fall down in the late night. At this time, the Gemini meteor shower's radiant point would also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the last few hours of the night after the moon has set, but they should take precautions against cold and keep warm. "
How can we observe as many shooting stars as possible?
It is not advisable to observe the moon in the city. You can choose a place with a high altitude, a small amount of light pollution, and a view to the northeast direction. Wait patiently after the moon has fallen, and then observe the moon visually.
It is important to note that the flow from the Geminid shower radiates in all directions, so you don't have to keep your eyes on the Geminid shower's radiating point while observing.
Friends who love photography will want to take pictures of a spectacular "meteor shower" with a wide-angle, large aperture lens. It is best to use a wide-angle lens with a high ISO and the largest aperture.
Based on stability and continuity, three-legged tripods, backup batteries and shutter cables are also indispensable. "
Zhu Liangpeng reminded.
What are the differences between laser TVs and traditional TVs in terms of market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional television referred to by the topic starter should be the liquid crystal television. The difference between the laser television and the liquid crystal television in terms of market positioning mainly consists of the following two points:
The first is that laser TV will focus on the large screen market.
Compared to the all-encompassing market positioning of liquid crystal televisions, it is clear that laser televisions are more focused on the large screen market, or it can be said that laser televisions were born for the large screen market.
At present, mainstream liquid crystal televisions are in the range of 55 to 65 inches, while laser televisions are in the range of more than 75 inches, with the maximum exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting users’ demand for large-screen color televisions.
In recent years, the shipment and sales volume of laser TV have increased continuously, and its proportion in the total shipment and sales volume of TVs above 80 inches has exceeded 60%.
According to the forecast of Zhongyi Kang, the sales volume of laser TV will increase more than 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain high growth.
The reason why it has achieved such good results in the large screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of laser TV in terms of eye protection.
Based on the principle of light reflection, the laser light source emits light that does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared to the backlight of liquid crystal televisions, the imaging process is closer to the natural condition of object imaging, and the irritation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Chinese Electronic Technology Standard Research Institute's Saisi Laboratory and Beijing Xiaohui Hospital's ophthalmology experts carried out a strict comparison test between the laser TV and the liquid crystal TV under the same conditions. They obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have very strong anti-glare properties, and in certain aspects even have a certain improvement effect.
With the increasing attention paid to eye health, laser TV has not only attracted more and more users, but also opened up a new breakthrough in the color TV market.
The second is that laser TV focuses on high-end markets.
While the price of liquid crystal televisions continues to fall, the price of laser televisions is mostly above 10,000 yuan. As the size and light source are upgraded, the price will gradually rise.
What makes a laser TV so expensive?
There must be something to it.
With the development of light source and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be realized by liquid crystal TV and projection.
Thanks to ultra-short focal distance projection technology, laser TV's projection distance is relatively short compared to traditional projection devices. It can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance, and the space required is small, and the main machine is compact.
In terms of brightness, large-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, and the wear on the equipment is small, so the lifespan of the television is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, imitation screen, and other cutting-edge technologies, which can give users a more dazzling visual and auditory experience.
There is no false demand, but the product of demand segmentation. Talk about the quality of the picture and the cost-benefit ratio, the laser TV is not the favorite of the audiovisual players. If you want to combine the large screen and the viewing environment, you can try it. There are pros and cons for everything. Weigh the pros and cons and make your own judgement. Just beware of the one-sided words.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle near focus projector - laser TV - must use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors to get close to the screen, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To block part of the environment light, use the micro-structured Fresnel screen, which is expensive, and the price of the 80-inch screen is basically equivalent to that of the 65-inch liquid crystal.
Another thing is that I particularly dislike the projection manufacturers using the backlight as a selling point, thank you, the light rays on the screen can be seen by the eyes, even if projected onto the ceiling, the eyes can't see it. If you project onto the ceiling, the liquid crystal TV also projects "direct rays", isn't it also lighting up the ceiling? Turn on the TV and the ceiling will also be illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not a mirror, it will not become an image.
The glare effect of the high-gain screen is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes, which is really uncomfortable.
The Wen Shi Xiang Visual Aesthetic Photography Gallery selects quality shops temporarily
I added the appointment date to WeChat, and the girl sent me the available time. The reply was quite timely.
Before going, I looked at the photos taken in the shop, and most of them were outdoor wedding dresses. The photos were very beautiful, and there were many different shooting styles.
After arriving that day, I exchanged my ideas with the little sisters. They were very patient and helped me try two sets of clothes that I was confused about. Finally, I decided to start makeup and hairstyle. The photographer will arrange some props before shooting. He will also guide the actions and pay attention to the details.
But maybe because I didn't communicate my specific shooting ideas with you, so the shooting result is not what I want, but it should be good to look at🙊🙊
After taking the photos, the photographer will help me to select the photos, and communicate the post-processing style. I feel that he is quite thoughtful.
It takes about half a month to repair the film. Just sit and wait for the effect.
This was the second time I took part in a fashion shoot - most of the clothes in the room could be chosen to be photographed.
I chose a black chiffon skirt to experience a different style.
The entire shooting process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge of the shooting is the younger brother of the 95 generation, and he feels a little shy. I hope that in the future, he can give more suggestions for the customer's shooting action guidance. He is quite talkative. The shooting process is quite enjoyable.
The Wenxing Visual Aesthetic Photography Gallery Selects Quality Shops.
Go to the front page and check out Queenie.
When I went to the shop, I filled in my name and phone number first. Then, I could choose the wedding dress and veil. I changed three or four dresses, and I was very patient. After that, I was made up for a long time. The service attitude was also good. After that, they taught me how to pose. I felt that my face was big. They said that it would take half a month. It only took three or four days to send it. I felt that it was not much different from the original film.
The overall environment is good.
There are a lot of clothes to choose from.
There are three places to do makeup, in the middle is a photo booth.
The service is very friendly and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching you the moves.
If the photographer is not satisfied, he will proactively offer to retake the photos.
The make-up may be a bit too much, the original double eyelids were pasted out with three eyelids.
Even the tail of the eyebrow was shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for those who do not draw the eyebrow on a daily basis.
The photos have been around for a few days, but the PT effect is not very satisfactory. I feel that the double eyelids are still very obvious.
Because I wasn't sure what kind of style I wanted, I tried two sets. In the end, I chose a black gown. The girl said that this set is a bit retro.
After choosing clothes, I started to do makeup. The hairstylist and makeup artist girls were very patient in helping me. I was very satisfied with the effect.
After doing my makeup and hair, I started taking pictures. The photographer guided me throughout the whole process. The process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully selected four photos that I liked the most. The little guy said that the film was 15 minutes long, and the ending was very satisfying.
I've been waiting 3 days for a response... because your system can't recognise my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay.
I have to pay shipping fees every time.
Can you waive the monthly fee until you complete your investigation, and then collect it later?
Is it safe to buy umbrellas with insurance?
Small Rain Umbrella is an insurance agency platform for the Internet.
From the perspective of setting conditions, according to the suggestion of the Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (2015 Revision), to become an insurance brokerage company, you must meet three key words: the shareholders and the founders must have no major violations in the last three years, the minimum limit is RMB500 million, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory and Supervisory Authority.
These three are actually very stringent, summarized it is to have strength, to go through the approval of the national power department of the Silver Insurance Supervisory Authority, the shareholders must have a good reputation, as the umbrella insurance of the Rain Umbrella Insurance Company, the insurance buyers do not need to doubt whether the Rain Umbrella Insurance is regular or not, because there are these three thresholds, not all insurance companies can meet them.
In this regard, it's not bad, it's worth relying on.
From the perspective of insurance products, Rain Umbrella Insurance is a supermarket for insurance. Many companies’ star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform. For example, the newly launched Haitai Super Marry 5 No. critical illness insurance, the claimant and insurer are Haitai Insurance, and Rain Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary. It is not necessary to question its reliability.
From the payment mode, the Internet platform's products are cheaper because they do not have the operating expenses of a brick-and-mortar store and the salaries of agents. Therefore, Internet products are generally cheaper. Besides, the payment method is flexible and supports monthly payments, which relieves the pressure of paying premiums for insurance buyers and maximizes the leverage of insurance.
That's pretty good.
It can be considered.
In terms of professionalism, this is very important, because insurance is an industry that requires a very high level of professionalism, and many Internet product customers can purchase insurance on their own. This will inevitably lead to a lot of misconceptions in the health declaration and occupational fields. Non-insurance professionals will often add their subjective opinions when they purchase insurance. They will think that they are healthy or meet the requirements. This will inevitably lead to a lot of risks of reimbursement. There is a possibility that they will be denied reimbursement.
I used to work for "Tencent Micro Insurance" (and the same as Rain Umbrella, it is an Internet insurance agency platform). I am very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is genuine and reliable, and the unreliable ones are the people. The Internet channel does not have professional personnel, and there are many sales misguided.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 600,000 yuan, buy insurance and get a mobile phone for free, free to receive 600,000 yuan of major illness insurance. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are superficial, and they will not tell the insurance buyers that the first month is 1 yuan, and the second month is charged according to the normal fee, and several tens to 200 are not equal. A lot of insurance buyers will be charged for a couple of years.
The insurance company would pay out $600,000 (the world drops a biscuit).
Free phones are given to those with special insurance numbers such as 6666, 8888, and so on. If you win the lottery, the short message will be sent to you, but if you don't exchange it, no one will remind you.
For the insured person, it is another pit. Free to receive 60,000 RMB of long-term disability insurance, it is short-term, if only relying on this, there is no other commercial insurance, 60,000 RMB will not be able to solve the problem, and the life of the insured person will start to be naked.
At present, the misleading of Internet insurance sales is being severely cracked down by the country.
Therefore, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, and the problem is the professionalism and professionalism of the businessman.
It is suggested that the title holders should carefully consider it. In fact, there are many offline insurance agency companies whose products are more comprehensive, and customers can choose more opportunities and products. Some products also have a better cost-benefit ratio than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers, guaranteeing offline products, saving RMB 2,000-3,000 per person per year.
If you have any questions, feel free to communicate with me.
I: an insurance broker with 3 years of business management training experience, I have served more than 1,000 corporate users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing insurance, I will start from the needs of the customers, and customize insurance products for the customers. During the purchase of insurance, I will do my best to get the best underwriting result for the customers. After purchasing insurance, I will do the insurance policy consolidation and insurance policy custody for the customers, so that the customers can be at ease.
To grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the topic starter.
According to the definition of the insurance regulator, the Internet insurance is the insurance business that the insured person can independently complete all the insurance procedures after clicking the insurance link.
During this process, the insured person does not need to sign, and the insurance agent does not need to sign either. All steps can be completed by the insured person independently.
Although the Internet insurance has no "ceremonial feeling", it may not even have a printed paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" type of mass production work, but such a purchase of insurance will also have a fatal problem, which is that - the subsequent service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for several decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is a "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services in the future?
How do I get in touch with the food delivery specialist?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Isn't it time to compensate me?
I said I would knock on the door to deliver the goods.
But the rider left his horse at the door, and then he left.
I also sent the wrong one.
Your delivery riders have already taken one of my orders, but they are still telling me to wait.

All you need to do is to redeem the discount code.
No problem, no need to arrange a special delivery, I have already bought another one. I don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to now, I have always opposed any form of defamation and slander, and I cannot accept the behavior of attacking a person.
In a civilized society, we can embrace all things, but we will not tolerate this kind of villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From the moment you started sending Facebook requests to add me as a friend, followed by posting funny posts, and then trying to publish the alleged location of my home and my father's name on social media, I've already taken a no-response attitude.
Afterwards, you continued to tag me at the same frequency of six meals per day, and even on Facebook with your so-called friends, you continued to talk about me about some obscure, humiliating things, appearance, figure, good living habits, what kind of bedroom plants, whether to insert or not, and so on. I... also counted.
How did I come to receive photos of you on your Facebook friend's page, as well as sexually harassing remarks about you?
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent.
After the news was published, you did not calm down at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, and I don't care what your social status is. In our society, we need to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this kind of ambiguous, obscure, humiliating, and insulting language, and you can continue to say that you're just concerned and interested in me, and you can continue to say that it's not harassment, and you can continue to say that it's not your fault.
No, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to comment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to put up with such humiliation for the sake of fame.
My friend asked me, how are you doing?
I say so, and you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl would be able to say that they're okay after being bullied like that.
Whether in the workplace, in society, in politics, or in business, only those who have no basic decency will choose this way to hurt any woman.
I believe that justice and righteousness are in the hearts of people.
I cut off some of the comments for you to read.
Your own post shouldn't be able to be faked by anyone, right?
I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization.
With a smile on his face.

The household appliances and electrical appliances here are complete, the brands are many, and the famous brands are complete.
On December 12th, go to the "Hansdton" water purifier store, look at the water purifier, the store is doing a promotion, the price is relatively cheap.
The residence has 11 floors, from the basement to the ninth floor, the basement and the second basement are for parking, and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are not very good, there are very few hardware stores, and the taste of the restaurant is not very good.
This elevator is also very frustrating. It goes from floor 2 to floor 1, back and forth, and I pressed this floor, from the safety corridor down to the first floor, and then went to a furniture store, but the furniture store was closed, and the safety corridor didn't go out!
There is still room for improvement, and there are many places that have not been developed.

The upper reaches of the Yangtze River achieve full coverage of water-based green integrated services - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Hubei, December 11th (reporter Wang Xian). The Yongle Water Green Color Comprehensive Service Area in Chongqing was officially put into operation on December 10th. This is the second Water Green Color Comprehensive Service Area on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Lengzhou Water Green Color Comprehensive Service Area was put into operation on December 8th.
With this, the green integrated service area covering the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River has been covered.
Transportation and Traffic Management Bureau Deputy Director Qiu Jianhua explained that before, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu provinces had built 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which were well received by ship crews, and played an important role in promoting high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the green service area on the water is another milestone event in the construction of the green navigation of the Yangtze River, and the reception and processing of shipborne pollutants and the service capability of the Yangtze River shipping have been significantly improved.

The two water-based green integrated service areas built and put into operation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River this time, integrate life services, production services and government services as one, with green environmental protection as the main theme, with ship repair and emergency rescue services as the special feature, realizing “one berthing and multiple services”, which will make it more efficient for ship crew to work and convenient for them to live.
The United States Three Aircraft Carriers Gathered Around China; The Strongest Weapon in the Weapon Vault of the United States Armed Forces is Rarely Visiting Guam; The United States media reported that the latest news of China-US relations: The latest satellite image showed that the three aircraft carriers of the United States were gathered around China; the United States media also revealed that the United States Armed Forces released an important signal to its allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region by showing the strongest weapon in the weapon vault of the United States Armed Forces.
According to the South China Strategic Sensing Platform, on January 9th, the satellite detected the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Babarakak Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first chain of islands in the West Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Calvin Wenson" will head to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the F-35C fighter jet and the CMV-22 "fish hawk" ship-based transport aircraft.
The U.S. Navy aircraft carriers now roaming the Pacific Ocean include the Carl Vinson and the Abraham Lincoln, which left the United States on January 3.
The "Lincoln" also carried the first F-35C carrier aircraft squadron, the 314th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the U.S. Marine Corps.
Besides the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the United States Navy has also deployed the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier to the Asia-Pacific region, docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the "Yan Ping Lake" missile destroyer, the "Stockdale" missile destroyer, and other missile destroyers.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon is rarely seen visiting the island of Guam. On January 17, 2022, the South China Strategic Observation Platform released the latest satellite image, showing that the three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China.
South China Strategic Observation Sensing (Weibo @ South China Strategic Observation Sensing). The U.S. three aircraft carriers gathered in the vicinity of China. The most powerful weapon rarely visited Guam. On January 17, 2022, the U.S. aircraft carrier CMV-22B flight route.
According to the Weibo account of South China Strategic Sensing, as reported by CNN on January 17, the United States Navy’s most powerful weapon, the Tomahawk cruise missile, visited Guam last weekend.
The nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Guam Naval Base last week (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon is rarely seen visiting the island of Guam. It is analyzed that this is a signal sent to the allies and enemies in the tense situation of the Indian Ocean-Pacific region.
This is the first time since 2016 that a US ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam, and the second time since the 1980s that it has been made public.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon is rarely seen visiting the island of Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
The photo shows China's Yongxu Island in the South China Sea.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the Russian nuclear submarine "Kursk" made this visit to Guam to enhance the cooperation between the United States and the region and demonstrate the United States' capabilities, flexibility, and deterrence posture, as well as its commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
The ballistic missile submarine is commonly referred to as the Boomer submarine.
The movements of the 14 "Thunderbolt" submarines of the U.S. Navy are usually kept secret.
The secret around the ballistic missile submarine "Thunderbolt" made the "nuclear triad" the most important survival weapon, which also includes the launch tube for ballistic missiles in the United States and the B-2 and B-52 bombers carrying nuclear bombs.
Talking to a friend about the recent 26% drop in Meta's share price and the loss of $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded, "We're facing unprecedented competition." Why?
Meta (previously Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with most of its revenue coming from ads, and today's money-making advertising company, which has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on, no matter what the functional positioning is, are the traffic channels of Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "ad alliance", many Apps are connected to Meta's advertising platform through Meta's advertising platform to realize monetization.
But the times, they are a-changin'.
First, the change in Apple's privacy policy made it difficult for Meta to get user data, affecting the efficiency of advertisement placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly and will clearly prompt users whether they allow apps to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is not to allow apps to access their information.
If Google continues to throw another monkey wrench into the works, the impact on Meta's revenues will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has been weakened (the extent of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Most people know that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mostly from Chinese companies doing business overseas.
Meta has about 400 people in its Hong Kong office and a few large agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an inevitable advertising channel. Most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, TT is one of Meta's main competitors, but two years ago, Meta made a lot of money from TT.
All the agents in China are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta, and Meta's performance in the Greater China region is also quite good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but I'm sure it won't be as good as it used to be.
Chinese companies are no longer burning cash overseas at a large scale.
Thirdly, the expansion of new traffic channels has not been successful.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets aren't just looking at income, they're looking at what the future looks like.
It's clear that Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about "metaverse".
The metaverse is definitely a future direction, but the realization period of the metaverse is long, and this story cannot support Meta's market value in the next two or three years.
Therefore, in the next two years, it should be a difficult period for Meta.
Don't be fooled by Facebook's glossy sheen. It's raking in $10 billion to $20 billion a year in revenue, and it's in a precarious position. Compared to other Internet companies and high-tech firms, it doesn't have much of a safety net.
Although his several social media apps now have a high daily activity, they are mainstream social media apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. However, in the face of TikTok's rapid development, Facebook does not have much confidence, and the disruption between the two is just a blink of an eye.
While the concept of the metaverse is an idea that is impossible to achieve in the short term, there is no chance of success. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg is changing the company's name and is constantly looking for new tracks. However, I think that his track selection is wrong, and it is a dead-end track. The above is my thoughts for reference.
