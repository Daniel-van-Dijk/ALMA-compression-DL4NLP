Students sing the main role at the academic conference of Zhejiang University, and the research results make people's minds go wild - Xinhua News Agency
Use air to wash your hands, judge the disease by breathing, and accurately search for the source of haze. At the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of innovative academic achievements were awarded.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers environmental, mechanical, energy, medical, life science, humanities education, and other major fields. Students started from a point of curiosity and created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards in China and internationally.
Bio Sensors: Your Family Doctor at Home
Zhang Dingming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-end biological sensor on the spot, which was only half the size of a smartphone.
“All you have to do is breathe lightly, and this device can detect your health condition from the composition of the air you exhale. ”
According to Zhang Dingming, this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the smartphone after exhaling the gas.
Generally, the smart watches on the market can detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biological sensor uses graphene, a new type of material. Its target is chemical elements, and its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the health status of the body.
Smart surgical light: the doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland, this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students of the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, broke new ground in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented the smart LED surgical no-shadows lamp.
“Many diseases are detected and removed late, and this is related to the light used in the operating room by doctors. ”
Shen Junfei said that, for example, if the doctor cannot clearly see all the tumor tissues in the early stage of cancer, the cancer cells will still spread.
The smart surgical light has four lamps, which can adjust the spectrum to enhance the difference between different tissues under light.
During the surgery, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness of the light, the spectrum, the uniformity of color, and the light transmittance at any time according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This smart surgical light has been used in Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Children's Hospital and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Air washing: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by splashing water, rubbing some soap, and squeezing some hand sanitizer, but Li Qichang and his classmates have invented an “air hand washing device”.
As long as we stand on the sink, our weight will squeeze the air out.
It's like a balloon.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
This way, we can wash our hands cleanly!"
The color-changing reaction and the bacterial residue test proved that the effect of washing hands by this method was the same as that of the ordinary washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force to ensure cleanliness and save up to 90% of water. The whole process is completely pollution-free and energy-saving.
At the second Global Grand Challenges Summit last year, this invention stood out among the world's top universities and won the only gold award.

A very meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I think is important besides my driver's license!
A brief introduction: emergency measures are actually emergency rescue measures, i.e. emergency rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a period of time between the accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
It's time for emergency care at this point.
If I really had a heart attack, a stroke, or stopped breathing, the window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So how important it is for people around you to know first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of standing there helplessly and doing nothing. This feeling of helplessness is too scary.
In China, we have official data of 3 million people dying unexpectedly every year, the most dangerous of which is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the national average is 15%.
In the casino hotels in Las Vegas, 78% can be rescued, while Shanghai and Beijing are below 1%.
This is what the founder of the first reaction, Liu Le, said.
If a person goes into cardiac arrest, stops breathing, and stops having a pulse, you can't do CPR on them.
It may be possible to save the person if artificial respiration and chest compression are performed.
I found that few people have this awareness to learn first aid now, but it is too late when the thing happens, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can make a timely response when we face an emergency.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
Emergency First Aid Certificate can be enrolled in your local Red Cross Training Center, I enrolled in the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai, and students also have discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve before I turn 25, and adding the first-aid certificate to the list of goals was a few months ago, but I did achieve it!
Then I will go to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw that there was a diving emergency certificate on Little Red Book before. It seems that you need to have an emergency certificate to take the diving emergency certificate. In fact, the emergency certificate is very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#
The shrimp dumplings cost 13 yuan each!
I haven't tried it.
How can #NAME# not be clear?
One for 13 yuan?
Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# sent the wrong meal, and this time it's just one shrimp dumpling for me to eat?
Because I saw that it was valid when I entered the code before
First of all, let's talk about the conclusion. In my opinion, "Four Seas" is a bad film in all aspects.
But whether or not this movie is a highlight, at least the music selection is not bad.
There are many kinds of bad movies, the kind that makes you fall asleep in the theater is one kind, the kind that makes you angry after you see it is another. For the audience, "Four Seas" is like a monkey in Emei Mountain, it can ignite your anger in many different ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly a genius.
The most painful thing about this film is that it feels like a creation from the world of Kafka, incomprehensible and riddled with holes, just like the windbreaker worn by Maigret.
Even after you've seen it, you'll wonder if there's a hidden allegory in there somewhere, but when you think about it, it's really just a pile of shit.
First, let's talk about some of the scenes that are hard for me to understand.
The main character lives in a small island somewhere in the south, and lives with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish that she wanted to see the snow, and then the story arranged that the old man in the neighborhood drove her to the northeast to see the snow.
A senior citizen riding a bread truck from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
They and their father are very confident about this.
And then the old man just disappeared.
Opening a hotel on a derelict ship, how did the female protagonist get a business license?
Why can the little hooligans on the island easily block a section of mountain road?
Then the trucks carrying steel bars stopped in the middle of the road, and the drivers of the trucks could not be found anywhere.
This is too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a small-time criminal with a bad credit record and suspected of law-breaking become a traffic warden?
Why don't you report high-interest loans? The police in the film even specifically asked if you had any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door with a key card in a hotel, and then forcefully arrange to find the hotel owner and sleep in the room door?
This nonsensical plotting pervades the entire film, so much so that when I think back on it, I feel pain.
Besides the plot, the worst thing about the film is its theme, or rather, the fact that the film has no theme at all, but is just a grotesque stitched-together monster.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to shoot a comedy, 20 minutes later, you will guess that it may be a motivational film, and when you watch halfway, you will think that it may be a story about the difficulties of young people in small towns, and after watching, you will have no idea what kind of film you have watched, and you will have deep doubts about yourself, and you will wonder why you have to go to the cinema to appreciate excrement.
Most people are familiar with the tropes of most genres of film, such as if you want to make a motorcycle movie, it's going to be inspirational and comedic, and then tell the audience how a talented rookie goes from rags to riches.
If you want to make a romance film, just tell the story of the love and hatred between the young man who likes to ride a motorcycle in the small town and the waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least the plot of your story should not contradict the normal world.
（For example, the character played by Yin Zheng, who just got his new motorcycle burned, but still can sing) can't open some brain holes that even Kennedys can't stand.
As for the female protagonist, who is not an idiot but behaves like a 5-year-old child in some aspects, I don't know whether it is due to the acting skills or the requirements of the director.
There's another thing I don't quite understand. Why is Han Han, as a race car driver, so passionate about adding crash scenes to his own films?
Would the arrangement of such a film in the Spring Festival holiday be to block the audience?

Yixin block making machine equipment is widely applicable to the new type of masonry materials for municipal underground constructions such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas.
For example: all types of inspection wells of drainage and water storage facilities, rain gutters, trenches, septic tanks and small constructions, wing walls of bridges, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the four sides of the modules are composed of concave and convex grooves, which form a chain lock when combined.
Compared with the construction method of the plastered masonry wall, the masonry wall of the retaining wall is superior in terms of shear resistance.
The module is a hollow structure, and after being combined, the vertical holes are connected in series, and the horizontal holes are connected in parallel. After the core was filled with concrete, a cast-in-situ reinforced concrete mesh structure was formed, which played the role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The module has grooves on both the longitudinal and transverse ribs to increase the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells made by the concrete inspection well module are not easy to collapse, sink, leak, etc. The wall body module of the mechanical performance of the concrete inspection well module is stable, and the operation is simple, and the standard size is formed.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with data input and output devices, which can realize the ideal human-computer dialogue, automatic analysis, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The wall body module mechanical hydraulic system adopts single-cylinder hydraulic transmission and double-cylinder hydraulic transmission.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the influence of the vibration of the main machine on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection井模块 brick machine equipment is equipped with a feeding box, a moving mold box, a discharging box, and an automatic feeding plate, all of which are completed by the hydraulic system independently, thereby achieving the purpose of reducing the wear and tear and maintenance of the machine.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, seals and hydraulic parts, and ensures the overall stability and reliability of the equipment.
The wall body module vibration platform adopts the whole plate steel, the surface line cutting and molding without welding points, so that the filling box can freely swing to guide, and fully reduce the mechanical wear.
Reduce the mold load, filler and two-in-one compaction amplitude, adopt one-piece, synchronous, table vibration and mold vibration to ensure the shaking effect.
The wall body module vibration machine, computer automatic control of vibration amplitude according to the proportion of raw materials, no wear friction brake, extend the service life, reduce the cost.

Modern apprenticeship is piloted in secondary vocational schools in Chongqing - Xinhua
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year onwards, 60 technical secondary schools in the city will carry out the “modern apprenticeship” talent training mode, and the students who are accepted for trial training will have the apprentice identity at the same time, and will be pre-recorded by the trial enterprises after enrollment.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the admission and recruitment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and that the dual identity of apprentices, namely students of vocational schools and apprentices of enterprises, be clarified in accordance with the principle of mutual choice. The apprentices, schools, and enterprises must sign a three-party agreement, and for apprentices who are 16 years old but are less than 18 years old, the apprentices, the guardians, the schools, and the enterprises must sign a four-party agreement to determine the rights and obligations of each party, as well as the specific job positions, teaching contents, and rights protection of the apprentices during on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with enterprises to carry out pre-employment training and on-the-job training for enterprise employees.
Pilot schools should reform the mode of talent cultivation.
College and enterprises jointly design the talent training plan, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot is to train students for one pilot period, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the top-job internship is generally for 6 months.
In practice, enterprises should implement the enterprise workshop management mode. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can master the skills required by each rotation training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will set up 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, each of which will have 50 or more trainees, and a total of 3,000 trainees (apprentices) will be trained.
In accordance with the principle of pilot first and then implement, and then gradually implement from point to surface, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated education to improve students’ job skills and improve students’ employment rate and employment quality.

I have been thinking about this vacuum cleaner for a long time, and I finally made a tough decision. The vacuum cleaner has a good suction effect, and the amount of dust in the house is significantly reduced. However, it is a little heavy to hold with one hand; the back-and-forth wiping leaves dust marks; overall, I am very satisfied.
The rice cooker is heavy, looks high-end, and is suitable for me, a novice in the kitchen. My child said that it was better than my own cooking. I have cooked two dishes of meat and vegetables. The sugar-vinegar pork ribs are particularly delicious. It takes a long time to cook, but the cooking time is very short. The noise is very small, so you don't have to worry about cooking too much, and you don't have to worry about not being able to cook!
I received the goods. I cooked three dishes for lunch at noon. It is true that technology changes life. The timing and seasoning are very accurate, and the taste of the dishes is directly upgraded to the level of a chef. It is good, and it is a godsend for those who are not good at cooking. I recommend that you buy it!
I added a new member to the kitchen.

South African doctors: Omicron is highly contagious but mostly mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although the transmission speed is faster.
As the omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the country's Limpopo province said in a report to the Associated Press that the patients they are currently treating for COVID-19 are showing relatively mild symptoms, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.
The group's medical director, Unben Pillay, said he sees dozens of patients a day, but no one has required hospitalization.
Pile said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation. "
He said this includes older patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to become seriously ill from a coronavirus infection.
He said that, compared with the previous Delta wave, the patients he treated with COVID-19 "were struggling to breathe and had low oxygen levels.
Many people will have to be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first report of the omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to gather enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence offer some clues.
According to the summary of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases of South Africa: among the new coronavirus patients who were hospitalized in the past few weeks, only 30% were serious cases, which was half of the serious cases in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospitalization time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of the new coronavirus patients died, while the death rate in the early epidemic in South Africa was 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Africa, cited data from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and other reports to say: "So far, all indications are that this is a relatively mild disease. "
He also said, "It is still early, and we need to wait for the late data.
Typically, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we've only been in this wave for two weeks. "
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the dominant variant worldwide, cases of Omicron are now being reported in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
Health officials say the number of new cases discovered in the first week of December jumped 400%, with tests showing that 90% or more were the omicron variant.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education commentary: How to save kidnapped children?
If compared to the famous public welfare advertisement of "no buying and selling, there will be no killing", in a good environment where there is no "rescue" demand, group prevention and group treatment, and all-round anti-trafficking, the crime of trafficking will not occur frequently.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency release platform for child missing information developed by the Anti-kidnapping Office of the Ministry of Public Security.
This is an official channel for the publication of child abduction information, and a platform for the timely recovery of abducted children.
When I heard the name of this app, I felt very warm.
The new technological means are not only named "artistic" and sentimental, but also well-used in the information age, practical and effective.
Anti-kidnapping law enforcement, the first goal is to recover the kidnapped children, to protect their personal safety and freedom.
Secondly, the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be summed up in many "big words" such as individual punishment, social prevention and legal education.
However, before the trafficking case is solved, the safety of the victim should be prioritized.
The matter is of great importance and urgency, so controversial and disputed topics, such as whether kidnapping children should be subject to the death penalty, can be put aside for the time being, and cautiously discussed; but the rescue of kidnapped children cannot be delayed.
According to the experience of handling such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to leaving the scene as soon as possible after success.
For every minute that the search for a missing child is delayed, the child may move further away from their parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
In this case, taking effective measures such as the "reunion" platform, which directly helps to solve cases and find children, is a realistic action.
After all, "rescuing abducted children" is a big task that requires the whole legal system to operate.
Crime prevention, protection of children's rights and the rights of parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of justice and the strict enforcement of the law, all need to be carried out in accordance with the concept of "caring for the young and weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can be done better.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at the railway station, the parents are sleeping, and when they wake up, they find that the child is missing.
You can't expect a two-year-old to have enough self-protective skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have some protective instincts.
Both parents taking turns to rest, or putting the child in a safe place, are the minimum measures to prevent children from being kidnapped.
From the other side of the police crackdown on trafficking in abducted children, the buying side of the abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
Individual acts of wrongdoing are often just one link in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China, the minimum punishment for trafficking in children is 5 years, and if the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty may be imposed and the property confiscated.
The starting point is high, the maximum punishment is heavy, and the trafficking of minors is obviously a crime that is punished more severely.
However, there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people are backward in the concept of raising children, and their legal awareness is shallow.
The legal education of this part of the people should keep pace with it.
In order to effectively control trafficking crimes, it is not enough to rely solely on official strict law enforcement.
If the "market" for trafficking is widespread, the traffickers will be greedy for money, constantly innovate trafficking methods, and form a "fighting" situation with the law enforcement officers. The anti-trafficking action will inevitably fall into a low-efficiency quagmire.
Therefore, the elimination of backward ideas and the popularization of legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crime of buying and selling children.

There were no receipts in the bag.
We can't track them down.
I hope you can understand it.
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than the display.
No, thank you.
Yes, there has been a change of rider.
He's been waiting a long time.
The restaurant has always said it is in the process of handling it.
Waiting for a few hours
The International Olive Council classifies olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil, with five grades.
Cold-pressed olive oil, also known as extra virgin olive oil, is obtained directly from freshly harvested olives by mechanical cold pressing, filtration and other processing.
According to the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO): It is the highest grade, highest quality olive oil and is a pure natural product.
The taste is exquisite, with the fragrance of plants, and the acidity is less than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: acidity is slightly higher, but no more than 2%, flavor is pure and fragrant.
Common Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Ordinary Virgin): Taste and flavor are good, acidity is less than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained by refining olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Pure olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil mixed with a certain amount of extra virgin olive oil to blend the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, transparent pale yellow.
Refined Olive Pomace Oil: Refined olive pomace oil is obtained by extracting and purifying olive pomace through solvent extraction.
If you've looked at the rating system, you'll know that acidity is a very important indicator for olive oil.
After all, olives are like grapes, which are used to make wine. Olives from different regions and different varieties of olives will produce different standards of olive oil.
Olive Oil's Best Growing Areas:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil, temperature, sunshine, air humidity and rainfall for growing olive oil.
It can only be planted sporadically in other areas, such as the Mediterranean coast.
Main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and others with similar climates, such as Argentina and Peru in the Southern Hemisphere.
Olive Harvest Months:
Olive trees bloom and bear fruit between June and October each year. Fruit begins to develop in July and matures in October, changing from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the harvest season (freshness of olive oil is very important).
The nutritional value of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in fatty acids, such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is believed to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition of all the oils discovered so far.
Democratic Summit Closes, Biden Says Freedom's Flame Will Never Go Out
The online "Democracy Summit" (Summit for Democracy) hosted by U.S. President Biden on Friday (Dec. 10) ended with the participation of government leaders and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world.
Biden said in his closing remarks that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world, and the dictatorship can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Tang Fei, the Taiwanese government representative, and Lo Kin-man, a democracy and human rights activist currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know the work ahead is daunting.
But we also know that we can meet these challenges because, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
The flame of freedom can never be extinguished by a dictatorship. It burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the efforts of the whole society.
He said, "As the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, and achieve transparent supervision and governance, which can better resist the buffer and impact of authoritarianism and those who seek power at the expense of the public interest. "
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting digital authoritarianism, and affirming the value of democracy.
It was the International Human Rights Day.
In his opening speech on the same day, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, also said that democracy is facing challenges all over the world, especially the challenges brought by new digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening the social dialogue, solving the issue of inequality, fighting corruption, updating the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lo Kin-chong delivered a pre-recorded speech at the conference, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and the ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been accepting China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the restoration of democracy is our top priority. "
Roger Wong also called on the free world to unite to resist the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you do not realize the threat posed by the CPC to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
This is also the reason we need to change. "
Tang Fei, deputy secretary of the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China, delivered the "Declaration of the Nation" via video at the roundtable discussion of "Countering Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values" and stressed that Taiwan is standing on the front line of resisting autocracy and tyranny.
He also shared his experience in building mutual trust through information transparency in the fight against the new coronavirus epidemic.
He said, "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we have always stood firmly on the front line of the global struggle against authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
Under the pretext of public health and collective interest, authoritarian governments around the world have justified the violation of human rights during the epidemic, and democracy has shown signs of regression globally.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without a lockdown and defeat false information without shutting down."
At the same time as the agenda of the "Democracy Summit" on the second day, the United States Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries with serious human rights violations in accordance with the law, and impose investment restrictions on a Chinese company that has been identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have already taken pictures and uploaded them to you.
I know.
But the restaurant did not know why the delivery time was repeatedly postponed.
Originally, it was going to be #NUMBER#
In short, I didn't call
I didn't eat it.
I will definitely complain.
Why didn't you say it earlier?
Waiting for you for so long
No, I didn't get a call.
Please notify him to send it to our company.
I don't want to wait any more than #NUMBER# minutes.
An hour and a half wait for a meal
#PRS_ORG# have not been delivered.
I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel it?
Hello, the chicken sent by the restaurant is alive.
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid that I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a club with a similar price.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can not distinguish, the expensive normal will be more friendly than the cheap drum, this kind of "entry drum" is actually industrial waste.
They are very weak, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, and the hard ball cannot withstand it. High-level players find it difficult to control.
Their logic and subtext is - tennis is so hard, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to spend a lot of money, so we'll give you a cheap one, you'll play with it for a couple of times, and then you won't play tennis any more, so this racket is cheap, and you won't feel bad about it.
When you can tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Then come back here to buy the expensive ones, and I will make money twice.
Spend similar money to buy a second-hand good racket, choose Prince or Dunlop, these brands are not well-known, so good rackets are not sold at a high price. A new racket costs 500 or 600 yuan, and a second-hand racket costs 200 yuan. Don't you enjoy having a thousand-yuan racket?
Friendly to beginners, but useless after the beginner stage, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the beginner stage.
Orders have been repeatedly delayed for delivery.
Could you follow up on this for me, please?
postponed
Thank you.
In other words, I already have credit?
Do I need to re-order now? Wasn't the original order cancelled?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant, but the delivered food was short of a lot, and the chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# does not want me to take the blame for no reason, please cancel
My order was for delivery only, so there was no self-pickup involved.

In fact, there are many requirements for dressing and matching for girls who are slightly plump.
The skirts of fat girls should not be too short or too long. The length should be around the knees, just enough to cover the fat part of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, the fat on the legs will be exposed.
Wearing clothes that are too long will make you look short and fat.
If you wear it in three segments from top to middle to bottom, it will make you look taller. Just use different colors for the top, skirt, and long socks, and it will give you a sense of elongation.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for plump girls, and dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. Black short skirts are also the first choice of plump girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially a short black skirt, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too noticeably.
The more popular it is, the better. And the color shouldn't be too bright.
Avoid making your legs and feet look bigger than they are, so that you don't give the impression of being overweight.
For girls who are slightly overweight, it is necessary to talk about the tricks of dressing and matching.
Chubby girls should not wear tight short skirts, and the top should not be too short or stuffed into the skirt, which will make people feel very uncomfortable. If your legs are fat, you should wear black long socks or net socks (the kind with fine grids, please), choose a printed flared skirt with a soft fabric, and wear a T-shirt with a ruffled collar to hide the shortcomings of chubby girls.
Of course, slim girls also have their own rules for wearing short skirts.
If you are wearing a short skirt, you should choose a top that matches the color of the short skirt, which will make you look taller.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most fashionable combination in summer!
If you are a plump girl with thin legs, you can choose a glamorous short skirt.
It can not only hide your big belly, but also show your advantages.
A-line short skirts will make you look slimmer, which is more suitable for fat girls. Tight-fitting tops will form a sense of layering and make you look slimmer.
Wearing a simple white T-shirt with a short skirt, even fat girls can try it.
Plus-sized girls can also be fashionable.
As long as they can grasp the rules of dressing, plus-size girls will also be the focus of everyone's attention.
After changing the dressing style, we should also exercise more in our daily life. Let's try to get rid of the micro-fat girl label as soon as possible 😄

Girl volunteers to be a target to raise money for her sister: "I'd rather be hurt by bullets than by words" - Xinhuanet
A girl was standing in front of a large wooden board at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, with the words "human targets, 10 yuan per shot" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a “Hangzhou girl willing to be a ‘target’ to raise money for her sister” went viral on WeChat.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square. The wooden board has the words "human targets, 10 yuan per shot" written on it, indicating that passers-by can shoot people with bows and arrows after paying.
The behavior triggered heated discussion among netizens.
Yesterday evening, the publicity department of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau of Xiacheng District confirmed to the reporter of Beijing News that the police had confirmed that the girl was the sister of the girl who raised funds. However, this kind of behavior is not worthy of advocacy, and after being admonished, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl on the street "archery target" fundraising admonished
In the pictures circulated online, a long-haired girl stood in the shape of the character "qi" in front of a large wooden board with the words "human targets, 10 yuan per shot" written in black ink. The wooden board in front of her had her bank account number and WeChat, Alipay and other account numbers written on it.
The photo caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believed that this was “begging for attention”, and there were also many netizens who expressed sympathy.
It was around 10 o'clock in the morning of the 23rd that we found the situation when patrolling to the square. At that time, there were already a lot of onlookers. "
According to an interview with the local media, the police at the Tianshui police station near the scene said that there were two young girls selling goods, both of whom were in their twenties and dressed in a youthful manner.
Among them, the girl who was used as a "human target" was crying and begging passers-by to play the game; another girl was shouting on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was fundraising for her sister's leukemia treatment. "
Yesterday evening, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou Xiacheng District told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali, and she was collecting money for her sister Ji Jiaying.
However, due to the treatment cost of more than 300,000 yuan, he could not think of a good way to raise funds, so he did this.
He said that during the process, the two girls, one of whom was the target and the other was the shooter, did not participate in the process, and there was no one shooting during the process, but there were people watching and taking pictures and uploading them to Weibo.
After police examined the bow and arrows, they were found to be outside the scope of regulation.
The person in charge said, "We don't advocate this way of fundraising."
After being warned by the police, she has left the police station.

What was the hottest thing in 2021?
There is no doubt that it is the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, the article "Look! Project Managers Can Win Gold Medals at the Olympic Games" was very popular. The article mentioned that project managers are absolutely the first in many projects, and no one can compete with them: moving bricks, traveling, staying up late is the daily routine of project managers, and firefighting, taking the blame, and apologizing are not a problem.
An article that seems to be a joke, but also expresses the daily hardships of project managers, and represents a lack of enthusiasm for current project management work.
Those involved in project management are also gradually choosing to take some action to get themselves out of the predicament they find themselves in at work.
From the increasing number of PMP (Project Management Professional) certification candidates each year, it can be seen that more and more project managers are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management 20-Year Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants in China was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified was about 420,000, and the number of valid holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP® holders.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certification holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer feasible to rely on the "old experience" to do things, and the rapidly changing working environment makes us know that we need to learn, and stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the road ahead.
However, does passing the PMP guarantee that project management work will run smoothly?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten domains and five process groups of project management, but they still don't know what to do when they actually do project management work.
Many project managers often report the following issues: lack of project management awareness, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to practice; lack of systematic project management process support, unable to implement work in practice, project estimation is inaccurate, sensitivity to control is low, and the project is dragged on; the division of labor is not clear, and the "old oil" in the team does not know how to deal with the cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance ...
Therefore, after focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, he has helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other R&D key talents, and has obtained the honorary titles of “China’s enterprise R&D management talent training demonstration base” and so on. The “Research and Development Project Manager Special Training Camp” online course of Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has come.
Development Project Manager Training Camp Online Course This is a way of online fragmented learning. It combines the real-world cases, tools and methods of many development-oriented enterprises, and helps you master the knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and advance your own project management.

JD.com Promotes Reasonable Consumption on the Eve of "Double 12" - Economic Observer - A Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double 11" carnival reached RMB177 trillion in national online payment transactions, a new high compared to previous years.
The variety of discount coupons and the eye-catching live broadcasts of online shopping once again made consumers feel the benefits, and this trend of consumer enthusiasm has made people marvel at the strength of the national consumer power, but it has also made people reflect on the influence of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer groups of the present day.
On the eve of "Double 12", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding all users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and to resist blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
In general, the performance of Chinese residents in financial consumption is good, but there are great differences in financial behavior and skills in different aspects, and the basic financial knowledge level needs to be further improved.
The financial literacy of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "the elderly and the young" will continue to be the focus of continuous attention of financial education; the "China Youth Debt Situation Report" released by Nielsen and CCTV Finance, and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance show that the young generation has a huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important channel for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation. Although the young generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, it is quite different from the "over-consumption" tag given by the outside world, but some young people do have over-consumption and follow-the-trend consumption behavior, and because of this, they have produced a large amount of financial pressure and debt risk, and even caused social problems to increase, and financial institutions should have the courage to assume social responsibilities and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiexin has always been committed to providing high-quality and considerate services to help the people build their own happy life. It advocates that consumers establish a good and correct consumption attitude, and actively responds to the supervisory call by taking practical actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young consumers.
Over the past few years, Jiexin has launched a wide range of financial knowledge education activities for young people, including university students, and has guided the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as cooperation with top domestic universities to launch innovative practice competitions, so as to help them establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan their consumption needs, and ultimately help them accumulate wealth in their lives.
On the eve of Double 12, Jiexin reminded all consumers to establish a reasonable consumption concept and a correct money concept, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid the trap of consumption borrowing, so as to avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
Consumers must plan in advance and repay the loan on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as buying a car and buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have operating qualifications.
In the future, Jiexin will continue to rely on its mature, reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated financial products to provide consumers with more customized and diversified services. It will continue to help the general public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and become a lifetime trustworthy consumer finance partner for consumers.

Vietnam People's Army - The Gulf Cooperation Council in the face of common challenges
The stopovers of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Noteworthy is that this is the first time since the Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed the embargo on Qatar in the middle of 2017 that Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, has visited Qatar.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt broke off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC, and has had a negative impact on the economy of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the January 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council summit, where all Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move toward "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore ties with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the country.
The Gulf Arab states have resolved their differences to restore relations with Qatar out of the need to unite for the common interests and regional stability in the face of common challenges.
During the visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land corridor between two neighboring countries in the Arabian Gulf.
The 725-kilometer long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the citizens' travel and the integration of supply chains of the two countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and 13 agreements worth $30 billion were signed between the two countries.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf coincided with talks between Iran and the world's major powers on the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which the Gulf Arab states have criticized for not being able to solve the missile issue with Iran.
The Persian Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
All the Gulf countries believe that if the Iranian missile issue is not resolved, and action is not taken to curb Iran's activities in the region, it will be inadequate.
In the background that the nuclear talks between major countries and Iran did not meet the wishes of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia held direct talks with Iran.
Its aim is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
It is one of the factors that contribute to the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming HRC summit will be the first since the end of the dispute between some member countries and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unification of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and put forward a series of measures to ensure that its member countries work together to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Good
It is said to be the loudest exhaust sound of supercars in New Subang!
This time, our team brought this car to you, which is the dream of many men!
It's the flagship supercar from Lamborghini, the replacement for the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
The price is nearly RM200,000, the road tax is RM11,000, four-wheel drive, why is it called the LP700?
With 700 horsepower, how fast do you think it is?
I don't know either. The acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h is only 2.9 seconds, which is faster than my myvi, which takes 30 km/h to reach 100 km/h.
The short wheelbase, the aggressive scissor doors, the huge air intakes all over the body and the 6.5L V12 engine under the glass, perfectly embodied the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the price of the car. You can search for it yourself on Google. The editor has summarized some explanations that Google may not give!
Too much attention, wherever you go, everyone is looking at you, it's uncomfortable! (It's actually fun)
RM1 for 1km (car owners don't care)
Practice getting in and out of the car, it's a little awkward (because you have to climb out of the car and get stuck halfway)
The roar of the engine is so loud that you go deaf as soon as you get out of the car (but it's still fun).
The car is too big to park in a normal parking space. I am afraid that I will be hit by the car next to me when it opens the door!
Lonely, because there is no opponent (talking about myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for their cars are welcome to contact us!

Involved in an accident worth millions of yuan!
The Bugatti Chiron and the Porsche 911 are well-known to car enthusiasts. The Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the Porsche 911's price is also in the million-dollar range!
The day before, foreigners crashed the million-dollar Porsche 911 and the million-dollar Chiron in just a few minutes!
Look at the result, it is reasonable to be noble!
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and values pursued by a university over a long period of time. It is the soul of a university.
Since ancient times, the spirit of universities has been of great importance to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, as well as the progress of a nation.
Since its birth as the first modern university in the world, the university has borne a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, it was born in the autumn of the national crisis, and its spirit has been deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the value concept of “cultivating virtue and benefiting the world” and the patriotic mission of “strengthening the country through education”.
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious. The competition in education, science and technology, and talents is becoming more and more intense, and the higher education industry, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the release of the "Comprehensive Plan for the Coordinated Development of World-Class Universities and World-Class Disciplines" has not only demonstrated China's confidence and determination to advance from a higher education superpower to a higher education powerhouse, but has also raised higher requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to join the ranks of world-class universities in a short period of time, given that there is still a certain gap, and accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines, so as to achieve “overtaking in a curve”?
Besides, the universities should fully play the three advantages: one is the advantage of being a latecomer. By continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas, learning and borrowing the advanced experience of world-class universities, the academic level and the quality of education can be significantly improved; the second is the advantage of culture. By inheriting the wisdom accumulated over 5,000 years in Chinese civilization, promoting the development of excellent traditional Chinese culture, and thus consolidating the power, shaping the brand, and improving the image; and the third is the advantage of the system. By playing the superiority of the socialist system, focusing on the goal, gathering consensus, optimizing resource allocation, and thus providing a solid and sustainable guarantee for the university to catch up with the advanced level of the world.
It is important to realize that the construction of world-class universities cannot be the same for all universities, and each university must have its own characteristics and characteristics.
Academic characteristics should have both common Chinese characteristics and unique characteristics in terms of target positioning, educational traditions and resource endowment.
For Zhejiang University, we will focus on three aspects of specialties in our education: one is to emphasize the cultivation of innovation and entrepreneurship talents, build an integrated environment for education and industry integration, and form a complete ecological system of entrepreneurship education; two is to emphasize the cultivation of interdisciplinary talents, promote the optimization and adjustment of disciplinary systems, and cultivate interdisciplinary new emerging disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; and three is to emphasize the cultivation of the system of education and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a comprehensive Zhejiang University-industry-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to adhere to the university spirit and make the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the “seeking truth from facts” motto, the common value system of “diligence, virtue, discernment, and perseverance”, as well as “embracing the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, opening the way for the people, and planting the foundation of the nation” constitute the latest expression system of Zhejiang University’s spirit.
It is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct educational direction and continuously accumulate the cultural height and spiritual power. It is rich in content and has a profound and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Hainanjianghe" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, which reflects the spirit of "the world's talents are used by me" and is embodied in the adoption of excellent educational ideas from world-class schools; "Qizhentongde" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and pursuing goodness, which means that universities should not only pursue the truth, but also accept the cultivation of morality and the tempering and polishing of personality; "Qiwumianmin" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of new knowledge, the creation of innovation in scientific research, and the reform and innovation of the country; "Shouwugongguo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always be in harmony with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University’s 120 years of education.
“A wise man hears without listening, and a man of insight sees without looking.”
Academic institutions in China should further focus on the overall situation of the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics, deeply understand the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, we should uphold the spirit of humanity and independence, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times, and the spirit of the nation can stimulate each other, and provide an endless power for the realization of national prosperity and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, as well as for the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

At the same time that NFTs were going viral, a new concept emerged in the cryptocurrency community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic started to get stable income from this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology. It combines various gameplay, including NFT, and is currently the NFT project with the highest trading volume. As of now, it has exceeded 3 billion US dollars.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily income exceeds 8.2 million US dollars, approaching King of Glory.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
Axie Infinity's popularity is spreading a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, they can not only get fun and economic benefits from the game, but also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by game developers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw the news about my friend's stock price, my biggest feeling was the choice of enterprises on the track, i.e. the choice of investment targets in the industry. First of all, it is necessary to choose an industry with a large growth space of more than 100 billion yuan; secondly, it is necessary to choose an industry with good growth potential in the future; and finally, it is necessary to choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and the flatness or unevenness of the track refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the adjustment of the tactical layout in 2021 and lay out the tactical layout in 2022.
The strategy is to "do the right things," which means doing things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing", which means doing the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, and the tactics is to implement it. In most of the tactical thinking, there is a space for strategic thinking.
For example, when considering how to increase the number of customers (strategic thinking), you can consider whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend horizontally to other fields (strategic thinking); when considering how to improve the retention rate (tactical thinking), you can consider how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); when considering how to improve the participation rate of activities (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct KPIs for activities to achieve the correct goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately recruiting new customers; when considering how to increase DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin has seen several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin its official currency, becoming the first country or region to do so.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the ProShares company to launch a bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the launch of the first regulated bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. capital market, and the further expansion of the investment gap of cryptocurrencies.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Thank you to my photographer and makeup artist for making me look this good for the rest of my life.
Complimenting the bride, she is beautiful-eyed, has a good appearance, and is a virtuous wife and a good mother. In the future, she will be thrifty and take good care of the family.
The groom can be said to have made a fortune, a lifetime of happiness, and a happy marriage.
The quality of the wedding photos is really good, just like what is said on the Internet, we and our beloved are very handsome and beautiful, and we are very satisfied.
The seller's service attitude is also very enthusiastic.
This trip was not only to enjoy the scenery, but also to take beautiful wedding photos, and to make friends with the photographer.
The wedding photos are too good looking, blowing up the photographer and makeup artist, you guys are super super professional.
I am very grateful for Mu sister's patience and meticulous guidance, and I like the photos I took.
When I saw the wedding photos, I didn't recognize myself at first.
As long as the photographer is good, you can also have wedding photos that are as good as those of celebrities.
The most important thing in taking wedding photos is that the photographer and the makeup artist are aesthetically pleasing. Fortunately, I met them.
After seeing my wedding photos, I realized that I was also a "photoshop."
Asian-American groups sue Harvard, other Ivy League schools over admissions bias - Xinhuanet
Xinhua Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23 to protest against the discrimination against Asian applicants in the admission process of three Ivy League universities - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Education Alliance, which filed the complaint, held a news conference in Washington on the same day.
According to Zhao Yuzhong, the chairman of the group, in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top universities has increased exponentially, but the proportion of Asians in these three American top universities has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities engage in a "holistic" admissions process that "sustained and systematic discrimination against Asian-American applicants."
According to Zhao Yuzhong, in 2014, Sanders and other scholars found that among the three universities, the admission rate of Asians was the lowest among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Tufts University have the lowest percentage of Asian students among all Ivy League schools, and that Yale University and Brown University have practiced de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yuxiang told the reporter of Xinhua News Agency that they hope that the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will investigate after the appeal is submitted, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their recruitment.
They also hope that the colleges and universities that are being sued will proactively address this issue and change their admissions policies for Asians.
Currently, the three universities involved in the complaint have not made any response.
The Asian American Coalition for Education was founded in 2015, when it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discrimination in admissions, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese American groups, the Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American education groups also participated in the appeal.

Just canceled the order
Why is it still being enforced?
Can you check to see if it has been canceled?
But I ordered at 5:09 a.m.
They don't know what they're talking about on the other end of the line
Is there a phone number I can call to reach them?
In September 2020, Mr. Li learned from a real estate agency that a factory in Yuezhong Town, Yueqing City, Zhejiang Province was for sale. After visiting the site several times, Mr. Li decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Liu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory with the family members of the owner of the property, and transferred 200,000 yuan by bank transfer as a deposit on the same day.
Lin signed the "Deposit Receipt for Factory Purchase" as the payee, which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, and the parties will sign a factory purchase and sale contract within one week."
However, after the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, the house purchase contract was delayed for a long time.
Considering that the two parties could not reach an agreement on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Lin Xiang returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Liu Xin.
After paying the deposit and preparing the house price, he was just one step away from signing the contract, but the seller changed his mind and refused to sell. This made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
As a result, Mr. Liu sued Ms. Lin to Yueyang City People’s Court.
The court finally judged that the two parties did not sign a formal contract, so they could not only blame the defendant, and it was reasonable to assume that the negotiation failed, so the case should not apply the penalty for deposit, and the defendant did not need to bear the double repayment of deposit for breach of contract.
After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the second instance court upheld the original verdict.
【Legal Advice】 In the transaction process, it is necessary to fulfill the due diligence obligations.
When signing a contract, as a buyer, it is necessary to perform due diligence obligations, such as verifying the ownership information of the property, whether the property has been occupied by others, and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes from arising when the contract is performed.
China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" after the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday (December 10), which was "to use ideology to draw a line, to turn democracy into a tool, a weapon, to use the name of democracy to do the opposite of democracy, to incite division and confrontation, and to divert domestic conflicts."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, carried out "democratic reform", imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated "color revolutions", and caused catastrophic consequences.
Democracy has already become the "Massive Destructive Weapon" used by the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is a move by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day summit was held via videoconference, with leaders from 111 countries invited, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also doubts internationally and in the United States, such as criticism of the invitees, including some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who suspect that the real intention of the Biden administration is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes to organize this summit.
German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the video democracy summit.
According to the statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, "Today's American style of democracy is full of disease. The problems of money politics, identity politics, party polarization, political polarization, social division, racial discord, class polarization, etc. are becoming more and more serious, and the American democracy is based on capital and is a "game of rich people."
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, and achieve transparent supervision and governance that can resist the buffer and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who seek power at the expense of the public interest. "
Democracy is not a given, he stressed, "we have to renew it in every generation, and in my view, that is the defining challenge of our time. "
Biden also said that "democracy and human rights are facing continuous and worrying challenges, and democracy needs defenders at this time."
The United States pledged to launch a one-year action plan after the democracy summit, including a proposal worth $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that each country will make specific and public commitments before the end of 2022 to improve its democratic system.
Biden said, "Let's make sure that all of our countries are upholding our commitments and reporting back to us on our progress next year."

How do you drink Red Wine Whiskey?
Everyone's hobbies are different. Some people like to collect, some people like to eat, and of course some people like to drink. Red Label is one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in the world, and it has won a gold medal at the International Wine Competition.
Each bottle of red label whisky has its own unique flavour, but if you don't know how to taste it, you are wasting its rich aroma.
So, how do you drink a red whiskey?
The editor will briefly introduce it to you.
Red Wine Whisky Drinking Method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label is a blend of around 35 malt and grain whiskies from the Speyside, Highlands, Islay and Campbeltown regions of Scotland. It has a rich flavour with traditional Scottish whisky characteristics of sweetness and smokiness.
The entrance is rich and fragrant, with a hint of grass and a strong smoky malt flavor.
It can be served chilled on its own, or mixed with your favourite drinks.
Scotch whisky entered China, in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese, Scotch whisky + Coca-Cola or Sprite or Fanta became a fashion that lasted for a long time.
These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the acidity, but also give people a pleasant feeling visually, and when they are added to drinks, they can have the effect of diluting the taste and changing the flavor.
Red Wine Whisky + Thinly Sliced Lemon + Sugar (Sand Sugar can also be used), is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The original red wine has a slightly sour taste, so adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, and lemon can give the wine a refreshing fragrance, of course, the sweet and sour degree can be adjusted according to personal preferences.
The above three are the best ways to drink red wine whiskey, and everyone can try it as a reference. I hope that the introduction of the editor can help everyone.
Educational Thoughts: How University Examinations Make "Geniuses" and "Dummies" Get What They Deserve - Xinhuanet
Three students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, expressing their confusion about the university examinations, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examinations, change the examination types, and let the examinations truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university entrance exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and different levels of learning.
It is inevitable that there will be different perceptions when assessing such a diverse group.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type and have a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause a different feeling.
Students who do not study well may be able to pass the exam by concentrated cramming before the exam. If they want to find other ways, they may achieve the effect of half the effort.
As a result, "academic slackers" can pass the exam even if they don't put in the effort, and "academic superstars" don't miss a single class, and their homework, notes, and test scores are all excellent.
From this point of view, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not complaining about the problems in the university entrance examination for no reason. It is believed that this situation is not only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this point of view, we should applaud the three students who wrote letters to express their feelings.
In fact, those who have graduated from college are well aware of the phenomenon of cramming for exams, trying to obtain exam questions from teachers, expanding the scope of examinations, and obtaining "targeted guidance" before the exam, as well as the phenomenon of carrying small notes during the exam and asking teachers to raise their hands after the exam.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality assessment direction, measuring whether a university exam is qualified or not is not only based on the comprehensive grasp of teachers on teaching and learning, but also on the basis of scientific examination.
When entering the undergraduate stage of university, the specialty begins to subdivide, and most of the specialty courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that the basic knowledge points of a discipline are the contents of university examinations.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic knowledge of the discipline. From the perspective of knowledge points, there is not much change. It is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "20 years ago, the basic knowledge of university mathematics was learned, and it is still being learned, and it is still the focus. "
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the examination questions are monotonous and repeated.
In many universities, the examination is generally composed of the examination group, and the examination paper is composed by the senior teachers of the discipline, and the examination marking is also participated by all the teachers of the discipline, which can to a certain extent avoid the situation of repeated examination questions.
However, it is necessary to design a set of test questions that are in line with the actual situation of teaching and learning. The difficulty of the questions should be distributed in a normal distribution according to the overall situation of students' learning, and it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the examination can dynamically grasp the difficulty and the type of questions, and at the same time emphasize the examination of basic knowledge, and at the same time emphasize the examination of ability. At the same time, it is necessary to innovate the design of test questions.
Examinations are the baton of university education. With what kind of examinations, students will have corresponding preparation plans. In the long run, this will affect the effect of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the suggestions of students and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Require each teaching unit to organize teachers to carry out discussions and course final exam comparative self-checks, draft examination papers and relevant regulations, and at the same time strengthen supervision and inspection of the examination paper drafting and reviewing and approving stages, fine-tune the assessment of scores, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
Solving the problem of the single type of test questions and the repeated questions is the issue that the university examination needs to face. Of course, the corresponding regulations need to be issued, but the key lies in the daily routine. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only to digest the teaching content, but also to digest the learning situation of students. Both ends need to be digested, and the teaching and learning will be better connected, forming a positive interaction, and the examination will be more in line with the actual situation, so that "academic stars" and "academic dregs" will get what they deserve.

Golden Lady Bridal Photography (South Street) does not yet have a branch
Before taking photos, we changed the time twice because we didn't arrange the time in advance. Lan Lan, the consultant, was very patient and helped us arrange the time.
I chose a sunny weekend to shoot it later.
Mrs. Kine's staff, whether consultants, make-up artists or photographers, are all superb.
That was the first time I ever did my makeup properly, wow, I can't believe I'll ever look that good one day, haha.
Xiaoyi and the other girl (sorry, I don't remember her name) did a great job of makeup, and the makeup was very natural.
The outdoor shooting was done in Jingwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, so I didn't feel cold. The makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and accessories from time to time. If there was anything wrong, he would immediately help us fix it.
The photographer was also very funny, and after taking pictures all day, he felt very happy.
During the selection of photos, because we saw a lot of cases on the Internet, we didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we selected photos, we didn't have any intention to add photos, and we directly selected the 24 photos in the package (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 yuan package, and I was shocked, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many photos).
Today, the photos were fixed, and Lan Lan sent them to me, and I felt that there were two photos that were not very good, and they immediately helped me to fix them.
I compared the photos my sister had taken before, and I was really satisfied with our photos. They were simple and fresh, which was exactly what I wanted.
I sincerely recommend that you go to Xianchuan to take wedding photos!
Set price: RMB 3999.
Mrs. Jin thanks you for your sincere blessings and wishes you a happy and prosperous future!

More than 3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth certificates due to shortage of anti-forgery paper
（Sarawak Report, 11/10）The National Registration Department said that due to the shortage of special anti-forgery paper, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and the number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the head of the Immigration Service, Khalu Aminu, assured that all babies who had applied for birth certificates had their information recorded in the system and that the certificates would be reissued once the anti-forgery papers arrive next week.
He made an explanation at a press conference on the issue of the printing of newspapers in Sabah for more than 10 months, which was reported by a website.
He said the issue had surfaced two months ago and Sarawak was also facing the same problem.
“One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory that produces the special anti-counterfeiting paper is affected by the epidemic, and it will be delayed to arrive in China. ”
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used by Sabah newspapers is different from that used in other states, so it cannot be borrowed from other states' stocks.
Kelu Aminu revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit-proof paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6, and was handed over to the printing company on June 8 for part of the printing work.
“The office will send a person to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, and return to Sabah immediately for the final printing. It is estimated that it will take 2 more working days (December 20th) to deliver the application to the applicant. ”
We will notify the applicants to go to the local bureaus to pick up the admission papers. "
He added that a total of 24,801 birth certificates have been issued in Sabah so far this year.
I've been waiting since 7:30 and it's now 10:30.
Isn't it about time?
I'm talking about food.

Education Information: Beijing Reduces the Proportion of Talented Students with Special Abilities in 2016 Entrance Examinations for Junior High School - Xinhua News Agency
On the 21st and 22nd of this month, the entrance examination of special talents for junior high school in Beijing was unifiedly organized by the Education Commission of each district.
This year, all districts in Beijing have compressed the proportion of special enrollment, and the competition for special enrollment is more intense.
Take Dongcheng District as an example. This year, the proportion of special talents in primary school to middle school in Dongcheng District does not exceed 5% of the total enrollment quota of the district, and the planned enrollment number is 380. The enrollment rate does not exceed 10% of the enrollment quota of the school.
Students with athletic, artistic, and scientific talents who have registered online are eligible to participate in the special enrollment examination.
In order to facilitate students to take the exam nearby, Dongcheng District continued the arrangement of the examination last year, and set up 1-2 examination sites in each school district, with a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination points are divided into examination rooms according to the examination regions, and the examination time is divided into time periods. On the day of the examination, the students will enter the examination points at different examination regions in the examination rooms according to the time periods.
On May 23, the list of students who passed the examination was posted online by the Education and Examination Testing Center of the District. Students could check their examination results online.

The President of the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina: I believe that China has the ability to hold a wonderful Winter Olympic Games in a special period - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Sarajevo, December 11 - The President of the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kvesic, said recently that Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and believes that China has the ability to hold a successful Winter Olympics in a special period.
The Chinese Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Qi Ping, met with the President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, at the Olympic Center in Sarajevo.
During the meeting, Kvesic praised the relations between China and Poland and said that he had visited China during the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008. He was deeply impressed by China's excellent organization work at that time. He believed that China had the ability to hold an excellent Winter Olympic Games in a special period. He was looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games and the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina was actively organizing the participation. He hoped that this would be an opportunity for China and Bosnia and Herzegovina to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation in the field of sports.
Qi Ping said that there is a special "Olympic link" between China and Poland.
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics was successfully held here, and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will open in two months. It will present a simple, safe, and spectacular event to the world.
The Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina hopes to deepen exchanges and cooperation in the preparation of winter sports events, the training of athletes, and other aspects, and will continue to play the role of a bridge. We will take the opportunity of the Beijing Winter Olympics to promote the cultural exchanges between the two countries to continue to deepen, and wish the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina a bright future. We also wish the athletes of Bosnia and Herzegovina success in the Beijing Winter Olympics.
Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the "Best Athlete of the Year" award ceremony, and Qi Ping, as a special guest, presented the award to the best young athlete in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The promotional video of the Beijing Winter Olympics was played in a loop at the venue.
I'm disappointed.

48 hours of negative nucleic acid test, set "buffer zone" and strengthen the epidemic prevention and control of port cities at the national joint prevention and control mechanism - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reported by Dong Rufeng and Guo Tiancheng) The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the epidemic prevention and control work of port cities at land border ports (excluding those connected with Hong Kong and Macao), requiring that people who have left land border port cities (except those connected with Hong Kong and Macao) within the past 48 hours must present a negative nucleic acid test certificate, and people who have arrived at land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after their arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the port cities in each province, autonomous region and municipality, and announcing it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that qualified port cities should study the establishment of epidemic prevention buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar, and frequent cross-border exchanges between the two sides.
Implementing a differentiated management policy for different regions, from one line of control to two lines of control, is expected to move the control line forward, compress the risk of spreading the epidemic, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the smallest social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, several local outbreaks of epidemics have occurred in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some places' epidemic monitoring and early warning were not timely, high-risk personnel's closed-loop management was not implemented, the regular nucleic acid testing was formal, the cold chain products' various links were not disinfected, the concentrated isolation facilities were not standardized, and the epidemic emergency response was not scientific and accurate, etc.
The notice requires that efforts be made from nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, establishing an epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, in order to make up for the shortcomings and weaknesses of epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to do a good job of epidemic prevention and control work in a scientific and accurate manner, so as to strengthen the prevention and control of imported epidemics.
The notice emphasized that each port city should carry out the epidemic prevention and control work and the work of ensuring the livelihood of the people at the same time, publish and open the hotline for the livelihood protection, and regularly check the supply of basic living necessities, prices, etc., and solve and proactively respond to the prominent problems raised by the public.
According to the notice, the cities included in the ports include the counties (cities, districts, autonomous prefectures) where the land, water, and air ports are located, as well as the cities (provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities) and the direct-controlled municipalities. The specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region, and municipality) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control, and is announced in time.

Unveiling the truth of the 20-year bloodthirsty killing of the US military on YouTube - Xinhuanet
（Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro documentary called "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the United States launched a war in Afghanistan under the pretext of "anti-terrorism" and forced the export of American-style democracy through the war. After 20 years of poverty, barbarism, bloodthirstiness, and the killing of innocent people, it has committed countless crimes against humanity.
Misusing drones to bomb hospitals, schools, and other civilian sites, twisting human nature, and establishing a murder group.
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up "black jails" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and humiliation.
One atrocity after another has stoked more Afghans' hatred.
As the video said, the "war on terror" in the United States has become more and more terrifying.
The war has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity and hope to the Afghan people. It has only brought a country full of wounds and countless killings and destruction.
Let's watch the video together to expose the truth of the United States under the pretext of "anti-terrorism", bloodthirsty killing, and the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article from a commercial perspective and from the perspective of the storage period, why this customer wants to entrust the logistics company in the bonded zone to do canning, although canning is deep processing, it does not belong to the scope of operation of the bonded logistics company, and the following text may be able to explain why the customer wants to do so?
I went to many dairy factories and saw many dairy production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of powdered milk and liquid milk are the same, and there is no difference between them.
So why is the shelf life of the bagged product one year, while the shelf life of the bottled product is two years or longer?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between bagged and bulk so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers or mother-level think that the quality is better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the expensive one is the good one.
There are also consumers who eat it because of this mentality and say that the taste or flavor of the fake one is different!
Now I will talk to you about the reasons for the hearing aids being expensive. Where is the reason for the hearing aids being expensive?
Why is there such a big difference in the price of their raw materials?
Because when manufacturers set the price, most of them consider that if the bagged price is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept, which means that the manufacturer's profit is very low, or there is no profit, so how can the manufacturer survive?
So they had a very large increase in their pricing to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers focus on packaging in bags, rather than packaging in cans.
And there are so many manufacturers who spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of advertising fees every year. Where do these fees come from?
You can imagine.
So, as society develops and markets are promoted, for example, the cost of promotional personnel in shopping malls, the cost of display in shopping malls, the cost of gifts for products, advertising costs, etc. will continue to increase.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly increasing new products, and the price is also constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product that has been released as a result of the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increase in the cost of raw materials will not exceed 3 to 4 yuan.
There are also some brands that are willing to do anything to promote their products. They will hook up with doctors in hospitals to help promote their products, and they will get a profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan from it.
On the other hand, the relevant laws in China are absolutely not allowed to operate in this way. In fact, this way of operation is to cheat consumers.
If you have a can at home, you can buy a bag of powdered milk and put it into the can, which can save money and increase the storage and sealing of the powdered milk. It will not have any impact on the baby.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of hearing packaging is longer than that of bag packaging. If the shelf life of hearing packaging and bag packaging is the same after opening the bag, the bag packaging is not easy to store and is prone to spoilage.
The delivery was late, and the food was cold. After being cold, it was hard and stiff, and there was no way to eat it.

Don't scare people off the starting line - Xinhuanet
When you go to a book fair, you can often feel the popularity of books on success.
Today's self-help books are full of "best practices" -- that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, it skipped over the most important and fundamental step, which is how to do it.
Because of this, all these books have a common feature - they either go all out and do their best, or they just give up; they either score 100, or they score 0; they either climb to the top of the mountain, or they just stay where they are.
This "best principle" is so correct that anyone can recognize it, but 99% of people will be frightened to death at the starting line.
Because this theory promotes a "you have to make a 180-degree turn, you have to make a commitment, you have to make a change" path, which is a fatal flaw for a lot of people.
It is undoubtedly self-deception and fooling oneself to shout "you must change" in the ears of people who are stubborn, conservative, and unwilling to change.
Most people will be intimidated by the word "change" and hesitate to move forward; or they will make a rash decision to "change" based on a momentary impulse, and then courageously take the first step, but it is often that the good situation does not last long, and they cannot persist for a long time.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "From Tomorrow" comedy skit is the most classic expression of this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem of the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people, making most people "sigh in front of the door".
Perhaps, the "principle of second-best" is a path that is more likely to lead more ordinary people to relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages the "theory of small victories", i.e. if you can't do 100, just do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb the mountain, just climb the sand dune in front of your house, because that is also better than standing still.
In short, it is always better to do something than to do nothing.
Because the threshold has been greatly reduced, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persevere, and the success rate will also increase as long as they persevere.
In fact, the successful path of adhering to the "second-best principle" is a bit longer.
In the end, the "best principle" is only able to inspire a small number of people, while the "second best principle" can effectively inspire more people to benefit as much as possible.

The resource volume of Qinghai Lake carp has increased by 0.71 thousand tons this year - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reported by reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the breeding resource of the naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 thousand tons compared with last year, reaching 108.5 thousand tons, which was 40 times more than the initial protection in 2002.
The naked crucian carp, also known as the Qinghai Lake crucian carp, is a rare and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake. It plays an irreplaceable role in maintaining the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to the large-scale killing by humans and the degradation of breeding habitats, the number of Qinghai Lake crucian carp drastically decreased. In 2002, the resource stock of Qinghai Lake crucian carp was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Chinese Red List of Endangered Species listed the naked crucian carp in Qinghai Lake as an endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of the lake and the breeding of fish in the lake, prohibiting any organization, collective or individual from fishing for carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake, and prohibiting the sale of carp and its products.
At the same time, through the artificial propagation and release and the cleaning of the main inlet rivers of Qinghai Lake and the design of scientific and reasonable "passage channels" and other measures, the protection intensity of Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources has continued to increase year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that as of now, more than 180 million fish have been artificially bred and released into Qinghai Lake, accounting for more than 23% of the contribution to the recovery of Qinghai Lake carp resources.
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important ecological barrier and water source replenishment area for China and Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area for controlling the spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the ecological environment of Qinghai Lake, and to protect the water-living wild animals, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued the prohibition of fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and built up the comprehensive prohibition of fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

I'd like to ask, is the takeaway packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag
Wondering if it was a delivery error or if someone took it, thanks
It's been an hour and it still hasn't been delivered.
I just read an article about fake holidays and it was too long.
For men who don't know, let me give you a brief introduction.
Most girls will experience their first period between the ages of 13 and 15, and go through menopause around the age of 50.
I will come once a month as long as I am healthy.
But it is not regular enough to be able to accurately predict, with a tolerance of about a week, you need to prepare in advance, and sometimes the luck is bad and you will also turn over (suddenly advance several days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the severity of menstrual cramps vary from person to person. Some people bleed for three days, some for a week; some bleed little, some bleed a lot; some have no symptoms, and some are so painful that they need to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance. Menstrual cramps change over time, and what was not painful in the past may be painful in the future.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and there is continuous bleeding for several days from the beginning to the end, and the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary napkins or sanitary towels to absorb blood to prevent bleeding on clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandin. It is effective to take ibuprofen immediately after the onset of menstruation to relieve the pain of the current month. It is of no use to take ibuprofen after the onset of dysmenorrhea.
During the premenstrual period, because the uterus is full of blood and excess progesterone is released, it is easy to have abdominal pain.
If it's about time, and you get a stomach ache for no reason, you'll get your period within two days.
It is best to change sanitary napkins every 2-3 hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Excluding sleeping time, the worst case is to change it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, which is 42 pieces. If you add the preparation in advance, there may be 50 pieces, which is not one piece per month.
Change the sanitary napkin every 5-6 hours, and the longest is 8 hours.
Hormones during the menstrual cycle may make you more irritable, and the hormonal changes during ovulation may make you more emotional and unstable, which is very unfortunate for your body.
However, the official crime rate data can show that women's ability to control emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional problems as an excuse.
The flow is not only blood, but also the shedding of the endometrium.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and it gradually becomes thicker, which can be understood as that the uterus is like a house, and builds a new house (endometrial thickening) every month to prepare for welcoming guests. When there are no guests, the house will be dismantled (menstrual bleeding), and the new house will be built again next month.
It's very inconvenient to have your period. For several decades, you bleed for a few days every month for 24 hours, and you also have abdominal pain and back pain. Who would want that?
However, people are able to be born because of their mother's menstruation. Menstruation is for preparing the house to live for 10 months when you come to this world for the first time. We should be grateful to our mothers for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to think that they were dirty and shameful, but the times have changed.
If someone thinks that menstruation is disgusting, they think that the body's preparation behavior for the birth of life is disgusting, they shouldn't say it in public, girls, stand up, don't think like that, you have never experienced it, you will never experience it, and you don't understand it, don't be so forgetful of gratitude and ingratitude, how can you face your mother like this, how can you want your own child?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary napkins, they are really good.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and sending the wrong gifts is disappointing.
You have to order an extra meal for the kids to eat.
Hope that the shop will check the product when they are busy.
Do you feel numb after soaking your feet in a footbath?
Choosing a suitable foot bath basin can have a good therapeutic effect on foot care. Today, the editor of Guomei will answer this question for you. I hope it will be helpful to friends.
With the improvement of people's health awareness, the whirlpool bathtub has become more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different grades have emerged on the market, ranging from RMB100 to RMB1000, giving consumers a large choice space.
According to the relevant data, the sales of health appliances such as foot baths are booming compared to traditional household appliances, but foot baths do not have a specific industry standard, so there is a certain safety hazard.
It's just too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!"
Mr. Li told the reporter that he bought a footbath for his father as a birthday gift recently, but his father felt numb in his feet when he soaked his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the footbath that caused it, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt the tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen, and the electric pen lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the footbath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the shopkeeper, and the shopkeeper’s attitude was not bad, although he returned the foot bath tub, Mr. Li still felt dissatisfied.
Because he found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulations on the popular foot bath basin in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable to which groups of people, what materials are guaranteed to be harmless, etc.
However, generally speaking, footbath basins will not have a problem with electricity, but there may be a few products that have not been strictly inspected at the time of manufacture.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a detachable footbath.
Water and electricity are separated, and there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can test with a pencil at will.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Daily - Hunan Daily News - Huanqiu.com
On December 10, the Hunan Daily reported that the 13th Hunan Tea Exhibition was held in the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center. The exhibition aimed to display the tea industry, innovate tea science and technology, promote tea culture, and accelerate the goal of 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Vice President of the Executive Council of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Liu Hong, Vice President of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand introduction at the opening ceremony: the source of the lake red in Xinhua will inject new vitality into the "colorful Hubei tea" with the rise of red tea.
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have given strong support to the development of the tea industry, and have promoted the construction of a billion-yuan tea industry, forming a development pattern of “three lakes, four rivers and five colors of tea”.
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea types have successively launched, and the tea-tourism integration in the main tea-producing area has promoted the income of the broad masses of tea farmers.
Feng shui is cyclical, and red tea is making a comeback.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after picking green tea, they would pick red tea and black tea, and tea farmers would have income all year round, and the output value of the tea garden would increase directly.
At the opening ceremony, the leaders of the province awarded the “Hunan Red Tea” trademark to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the trademark, and Xihu brought “Hunan Red Tea”.
In the new tea hall of Xinhua Red Tea, Fujian tea merchants saw a high-altitude tea called "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zhen, secretary-general of the Tea Association of Zhejiang Province, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors had some impact on the tea market, but from the Tea Expo, there were many highlights.
Xinhua Red Tea has a touch of red, which injects the connotation of tea culture. It is popular and hot, and the tea industry in Hunan is looking forward to a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?
I didn't want it, because I couldn't park downstairs, and he didn't bring it up.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered by direct perception.
Metaphysics is the basic principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic properties of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is derived from the phrase in the Yi Jing (Book of Changes), "The Dao is called the Dao, and the De is called the Jing" (The Dao is called the Dao, and the De is called the Jing). This was translated into Japanese by Ishizaka Tetsurō (in the Meiji period) from the word metaphysic.
Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy that includes ontology, natural theology, and related issues.
Essentially, ontology is "the study of what terms represent real things, and what terms represent concepts."
Metaphysical naturalism is the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
The method of naturalism is a research method that does not mention God.
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought on the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy concerned with the nature, origins, and limits of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic study and research of human moral life; here, morality is defined as a group of people or a culture's set of rules for all behavior.
There are two main types of ethics: meta-ethics (abstractly studying ethical theory or the nature of ethical criticism) and normative ethics (judging various different ethical views and providing ethical guidelines for right or wrong actions.
It studies what kind of ethical rules people should follow, applied ethics (applying ethical theories to actual life situations, including biological ethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and making generalizations from observed patterns).
It is not an examination of ethics from the perspective of an imagined theory, but an investigation of actual moral agents (moral agents) who make decisions and are observed, and all the factors that give rise to these decisions, including the ethical views of social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, and medieval Christian ethics.
Part I: The Moral Thought of Humanism, Represented by Valla and Montaigne.
Part 2: Moral Thoughts of the Reformation, Represented by Calvin.
The third part: Political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, English empiricism ethics, represented by Hume, 17-18th century, continental rationalism ethics, represented by Spinoza, 18-19th century, German idealism ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel, 18-19th century, utilitarian ethics, represented by Bentham and Mill, 19th century, evolutionary ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley, 19th century later, neo-Kantianism ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, 19th century later, neo-Hegelianism ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, 19th century later, and transitional ethics (non-rationalism ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and others).
Logic is the study of "principles and standards of valid inference and proof".
Logic is usually divided into three parts: Inductive Reasoning, Causal Reasoning, and Deductive Reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.
Aesthetics is the study of the essence and meaning of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To My Friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance during the 30-odd years since our relatives were killed. In particular, I would like to express my gratitude for the humanitarian assistance that has continued uninterrupted since 1994, when I made a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends both at home and abroad.
Nowadays, most of the deceased's parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their own families.
It was your generosity that helped us get through the most difficult times.
The COVID-19 pandemic is currently wreaking havoc across the globe, and most of the donors are retirees.
Therefore, I sincerely appeal to you to stop the humanitarian donation to the families of the Tiananmen Mothers, which has long been overdue.
I will always remember your kindness and believe that your deeds will be recorded in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, and I hope my friends will understand.
Please accept my sincere greetings.
Tao Yi said: I would like to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the history of humanitarian assistance by the IFCSS and MCDF for 32 years.
In the process of humanitarian assistance, the American Association of University Women and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, and the executors of the project often cross each other.

Assistance money is often not successfully delivered to the hands of the Tiananmen Square victims.
In 1994, under the suggestion of Master Ding, a special group was established to coordinate and take charge of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the “June 4 Orphan Education Fund”, which was implemented for 11 years. In 2009, after all the June 4 orphans graduated from university, MCDF set up the “June 4 Poor Elderly Assistance Fund”, which has been implemented until now.
Most of the funding for these projects came from campus and community donations from the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, as well as generous personal donations, and was supported by the Big Brother/Big Sister Democracy Fund.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Prison Reform Trust.
Until last year, after 31 years, the Tiananmen Square victims finally received a part of the donation raised in the name of Tiananmen in Hong Kong.
During this period, CHRD also carried out its humanitarian assistance projects independently.
We understand that Professor Ding stopped accepting donations for the Tiananmen Square Massacre was for the consideration of the donors, and we are indeed some retired people, and our income is not as generous as it was before retirement, so we would like to express our gratitude to Professor Ding for his “Letter to Friends”.
We will respect the family's decision and terminate the project within two years, and resume it when needed.
At the same time, I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those colleagues who have always been generous in donating humanitarian aid, even at the risk of their own lives.

Member reviews
Effect: Photo effect: I took two sets of clothes, overall it is not bad. I like this photo set.
Service details: Because I was pregnant, I felt a little uncomfortable when I was doing makeup. The makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while. They also kept pouring hot water for me.
Set price: 1000 yuan
Thanks to the rabbit's review. I originally thought that rejecting the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style, but the finished product was so beautiful.
Thanks to Dandan's recognition, we will continue to move forward with full energy, and we will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great! I highly recommend it to all my friends!
No matter from reception, makeup, costume, lighting, photography to post-production, there is nothing to complain about.
The makeup artist is very meticulous, he will match the makeup according to your style, and the makeup products he uses are all first-line brands.
Mr. Tian Liang is even more so. Photography is a very professional field.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens to play with.
We work in Beijing, and the better photo studios in Beijing need to make an appointment at least half a year in advance. My colleague has taken photos in Beijing, and I looked at the photos and thought they were just so so.
I went out of my way to find this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We are not good at managing our facial expressions, and we think that this is also the short version of most people. Photographer Liang Gao will take pictures and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Make-up artist, photographer, post-production, an excellent team.
We and the people around us all praised it.
I've already recommended it to my friends, and my friends were just as excited as I was when they saw the photos.
I hope that such studios will not be buried, and more people will find them, and shoot their own style, rather than uniform.
I am very grateful for the five-star review from Changying and Jingling. They are both very creative newcomers. We are a creative workshop. As long as the customers like us, we will do our best to complete it with 100%. Thank you for meeting and getting to know each other.
The sweet and caring assistant, as well as the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shooting experience, and the effect was much better than I imagined. Everyone worked hard, and I am very grateful to everyone. 😘😘
Thank you, Xiaoyu, for your comments. Meeting you is also a kind of destiny. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, our trust is thousands of kilometers away. I am very happy to meet you. I will come to Qinhuangdao to play again next time.
How do I give the money?

If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to self-study. After all, the cost of training is very high, and it takes 6 months to learn.
However, if you are planning to enter this industry, training is a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have a strong sense of self-discipline, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, we should look at the strength of teachers in this institution. If the strength of teachers is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some new training institutions do not have strong teachers.
Secondly, inquire about the training institution before choosing. It is best to inquire about the students of the training institution. After all, only the students of the training institution know how good or bad the training institution is.
Hello, I don't know how to answer your question, because I haven't introduced my own situation to you, and the relationship between learning this thing and one's own situation is very big.
For example, specialization, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you want to study in, will all be related to the field you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or if you are a computer major who has graduated, I recommend self-study if you have enough time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Now many offline and online training institutions are very good, but the learning cost is high and the investment of time is relatively large. You need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months.
However, if it is what I said, self-study is very convenient. There are a lot of free learning resources on the Internet now, and there are also a lot of training resources on B站. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to obtain free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos to learn.
If you are not a computer major, but you are willing to pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, it is recommended to go to the training institution to learn. This way, learning is not very tiring, the teacher's explanation is very detailed, and there are people to answer questions. In addition, it is helpful in learning planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions will sign employment contracts, and there are internal recommendations. After learning, they will recommend you to go to the company. This will also save you a lot of trouble in the interview stage when looking for a job.
The above are some of my views. Since I am not familiar with your situation, I have only briefly introduced it. If you have any other questions that you want to consult, you can contact me at any time to exchange and communicate.
I said 10 minutes before, I saw it on the app

Thanks to those who silently gave me a thumbs up, I will continue to work hard for a better life
Life will not disappoint anyone who makes an effort. If you like it, please follow me, and thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up.
Life is like this. Others only look at the results, but you have to support the process by yourself. In the face of life, we are not only strong, but also continue. We have no choice but to move forward...
Cleaning is both a job and a responsibility, life is beautiful because of service, and service is brilliant because of sincerity.
Although we are doing the dirtiest job, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer's house, and see the satisfied smile on the customer's face and the thumbs up. All the tiredness is worth it!
My day-to-day work
——Your requirements, my services.
Sincere service, sincere cleaning, and keep the beautiful.
The details that you care about, Fenggu housekeeping can help you do "clean" and service the love of the house.
To ensure the cleanliness of every family, to carve a monument for the housekeeping industry, to provide high-quality services, and to ensure cleanliness at home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Crystal lamps are beautiful, but if they are not cleaned for a long time, they will become dull and lifeless. Only after cleaning can they shine brightly, just like life.
Only with sincerity can success be achieved, and only with meticulousness can exquisiteness be molded. We are meticulous.
Give me a chance, and I will make you satisfied. Quality proves everything, because professional deserves to be trusted, and your recognition is my encouragement!
It's hard to make a living in any field these days!
However, I still believe that as long as I am serious, persistent, and hard-working, I will be better than others, at least I will be better than sitting and complaining.
A day's plan is made in the morning, and all the good things start from the morning. I hope you bring happiness, good luck, health and good luck to start a new day and keep a good mood all day long. Good morning.
When I was a child, happiness was a thing; if you had it, you were happy. When I grew up, happiness was a goal; if you achieved it, you were happy. As I matured, I realized that happiness was a state of mind; if you understood it, you were happy.
To be the most authentic and kind-hearted version of oneself, to follow one's heart, and to have no regrets in this life; to walk one's own path in life; and to have two treasures in one's life: a healthy body and a good mood.
There are different problems in every stage of life.
Often, it's not your ability that binds you, but your courage to face it.
Since we can't avoid it, we might as well face it.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be defeated by difficulties; if you face difficulties bravely, problems will be solved eventually.
The curators of China and Saudi Arabia jointly held the first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (reported by Wang Haizhou and Hu Gang) - The first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale - was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the JAX Art District in the northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries participated in the exhibition.
This biannual exhibition was jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing. Tian Yiwei, the director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, served as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biannual exhibition is "crossing the river by feeling the stones", which symbolizes the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six exhibition halls connected to each other. Six units are presented: "Touching the Rock to Cross the River", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Going to the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "The Spirit of Art".
In particular, 27 works by Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, covering painting, installation art, and performance art, among others; 12 works by Chinese artists also attracted a lot of attention, some of which used recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing's "Infinite Mountains of Xishan" (2014), which reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
Barkley, the chief executive officer of the Dariyah Biennale Foundation, said that he hopes that this biennale can establish an international dialogue and give global audiences an opportunity to understand the cultural industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia and strengthen exchanges.
Tian Huiyu said, "The goal of the biennale is double, not only to let Saudi contemporary art participate in global dialogue, but also to let Saudi audiences integrate into the contemporary art world. "
According to reports, a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biannual exhibition. Artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in employment assistance for poverty-stricken population, consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies on the management of public welfare jobs in rural areas to help promote the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, at present, 448,300 rural public welfare jobs have been developed in Yunnan, which are used for employment of poverty-stricken labor force and other rural disadvantaged groups, and have played an important role in helping poverty-stricken groups achieve employment and increase income, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the public service capabilities of rural areas.
This time, the new regulation was jointly issued by the seven departments of Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, Finance, and other departments, mainly to unify and standardize the scope of recruitment of rural public welfare positions, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions.
In terms of job position development, the new regulation clearly stipulates that job positions should be developed in accordance with the principle of “need-based recruitment, job-based recruitment, dynamic management, and total control”, “who develops, who uses, and who is responsible”, and “one person, one position, voluntary publicity, and unified management”.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, appointment, pre-employment training and placement.
In addition, the new regulation also clearly stipulates the specific duties of the main development departments of rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare positions, and stipulates that the relevant development departments of rural public welfare positions should purchase accident insurance for rural public welfare position settlers. It also stipulates that relevant departments should regularly monitor the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare positions.

Is it possible to cancel the order?

2.Although the rightists had a period of prosperity in history, it was not long, so they were short-lived because they shone brightly when they were given a little sunshine and sweated when they drank a little water; and when they were prosperous, they looked up to Sichuan and Shaanxi, and when they were defeated, they were like lambs waiting to be slaughtered.
But in all fairness, the right wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the rightists in ending the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving science and technology, promoting administrative institutionalization and protecting human rights should not be denied.
Three, in my opinion, although I do not agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements, and I also respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincere about China's social problems.
However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, deterioration of the people's livelihood, and the chaos of political parties. Moreover, foreigners will take advantage of the opportunity.
Fourth, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people. Political opportunists who take advantage of the fire will not be rightists, but scoundrels.
Let's talk about the left.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of orphans of time and politics.
If the right has a positive impact on society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing views and analyses of their thoughts at the right time. However, the left is not so lucky, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Five: Recently, I saw some friends scolding the robbers and refuting the leftists. I think this is unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with a traitor or a leftist. They are all the same, with no logic to them.
And don't try to prove to us that you're right, and don't try to make the robbers and the leftists admit it, what's the point?
I tell my friends: when the robbers curse you for five cents, when the leftists curse you as right-wingers, it is precisely at that moment that we are on the right path!
Many people had dreams when they were young, but when they grew old, they forgot their dreams or pursued their dreams but became obsessive.
And the ideal gradually faded away, and even the dragon slayer became a dragon in the end.
Generally, left and right refer to constraints and freedoms, and historically and culturally, China as a whole should be left-leaning.
Domestically, the right-wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and safety.
In general, the society wants to pay more attention to fairness, and the competition between China and the United States is inevitable, and it is likely that it will continue for a long time.
Even though I don't understand, I'll just give it a thumbs up.
I won't say anything else, Flower Flower is so righteous.
In the past two years, the blockade and encirclement of Huawei chips by the US empire has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US-based" enterprises.
The United States suppresses China's semiconductor industry, and requires its own enterprises and allied enterprises to block China's semiconductor industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global semiconductor suppliers are affected. As a result, the research and development investment of semiconductor production enterprises decreases, and the production capacity decreases, which leads to the disorder of the semiconductor supply chain in the global range.
Today, the "chip shortage" has affected all major industries around the world, such as car manufacturers suspending production and mobile phone price increases. Almost all industries that use chips have been affected.
In order to grasp the "chip" sovereignty, more and more countries' technology giants began to walk the road of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor industry and suppress the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has taken a series of actions recently. It has not only hosted the semiconductor summit; it has also invited 64 major countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and support the development of American semiconductor technology giants, such as Intel, the American semiconductor technology giant, has invested 20 billion US dollars to build two semiconductor manufacturing factories in Arizona, USA, and opened its semiconductor manufacturing business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's action would have a certain impact on TSMC, and it was very likely to steal TSMC's "dinner plate".
This is because Intel, as a veteran technology giant in the United States, has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor field for dozens of years, and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves. Therefore, it is certain that it will rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, the founder of TSMC, Zhang Zhongmou, did not care about Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master's Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou's words were shocking. He said that Intel's investment in building a semiconductor foundry was ridiculous.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's entry into the semiconductor industry is due to the fact that Zhang Zhongmou still remembers the grudge between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was a bright pearl in the manufacturing industry of the United States. It stood at the pinnacle of the world and dominated the semiconductor industry.
In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were in the hands of a few powerful people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured, and packaged by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model burdens some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs cannot afford the huge construction cost of the production line.
Inspired by the market demand, after the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to show the phenomenon of division of labor cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC was born.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) focuses its main business on "wafer fabrication" and does not engage in design. It only provides contract manufacturing services for semiconductor wafers.
At that time, the newly established TSMC was just a little lamb in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once approached Intel for investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing process of the semiconductor industry, it was obviously a little arrogant and looked down on TSMC, so it decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also judged that Intel at that time looked down on wafer fabrication services.
Nobody would have thought that the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services in the past would also have to start wafer manufacturing.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into wafer foundry was ironic.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is now worth more than Intel.
Faced with TSMC's strong offensive, Intel is naturally not willing to stand still.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is now racing towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at the 7-year-old 14nm.
It is not easy to catch up.
I can't wait.
I ordered at 19:06 after 2 hours 😅
Let's take a look at some of today's [strange] hot searches.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: Lunar New Year's Day, Hualun's price increase, and the Pinglala incident. The spreading of the public opinion forms a peak, and then the index decreases (smooth line) finally dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small peak again.
They look exactly the same as the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" shown on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six trending topics from the same event to present a peak, sawtooth and cliff state.
The “peak” is artificially heated up and rushes to the top of the hot search rankings, attracting the attention of the public; the “serrated” is cyclically heated up to ensure that the topic occupies the hot search rankings; the “cliff” is collectively withdrawn from the hot search rankings, and the hot search has fulfilled its “function”, and has received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat peak of one event coincides with the trough of another event, and the time is exactly the same, so it must be a batch of water army who received the task and launched a new round of attack.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen from the fact that dozens of trending topics were listed at the same time. Which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for disseminating knowledge, which ones provoke war, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgments, which ones arouse emotions, which ones influence judgments, which ones manipulate decision-making, black public relations accounts operate in batches and in stages, almost considering all factors in the spread of public opinion.
Public relations is a science. Disregard all subjective factors, including attitudes and emotions, and only look at objective data, and black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Everyone will leave footprints when they pass by, and we will dig out these footprints together.

Mauritius and other countries discover the first case of omicron infection - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 - Combined reports by foreign correspondents of Xinhua News Agency: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus.
Mauritius reported the first two cases of Omicron infection in the country on the 10th.
According to Kalisha Jagutpal, Minister of Health, one of the infected persons was a visitor from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27, and the other was a local resident who had been in contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the two infected persons tested negative for nucleic acid. They have returned to their respective places of residence.
The Health Ministry of Cyprus announced on the 10th that the first three cases of omicron infection were confirmed in the country.
All three of them are students. They came back from overseas travel in the beginning of this month, and all of them are mild cases, so they did not go to the hospital for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the Senegalese government has continuously increased the intensity of epidemic prevention and control.
From December 6 to January 10, passengers aged 12 and above entering the country by air will be required to pay for nucleic acid testing at the airport after arrival.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it would start to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer vaccine.
Malawi's health minister, Khumbize Kandonda, said on September 9 that the country had detected three cases of the Omicron variant.
The country's health department carried out genome sequencing on 12 new coronavirus positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found the three cases.

Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I#NAME# called your staff to explain
Your driver told me the address was too far
Great beauty 360 integrated home decoration
Address: 12th Floor, No. 156, Huancheng South Road
At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look. At first, my budget was 70,000 yuan to do a basic renovation.
A series of scams begin as soon as you enter the shop.
I went to the store for the first time and just showed them my floor plan. They didn't go to the site to measure the house, but they were able to give me a price of 70,000 yuan for my 135 square meter house. They also roughly showed me their materials, but I didn't know what kind of materials they were.
Their second trick is that if you go to their store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and this deposit is not refundable unless you have enough experience to deal with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we will give you how much discount.
This is a big pit, and I am a living example of being cheated. I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan when I was impulsive.
The quotation he gave me had many problems, and 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovation, and did not include any doors and cabinets and bathrooms, which are the main expenditures of the base.
They charge more for their services than other companies.
I lost trust in this company, and they didn't explain anything to me before I signed the contract.
When I went to get my money back, they acted like they knew what they were doing, with a special little team to deal with you.
No matter what, they will bite off more than they can chew, and it will be the customer's problem.
Various shirking of responsibility, as well as many details, I do not want to say one by one, in short, do not choose them, because my friend also chose them to decorate the house, and the quality of the house is not good, and they will give you various fees in the future.
It's a scam, they're the original con artists, now rebranded as "big beauty," like they've gone out of business again and rebranded as something else.
So please don't choose such a shitty decoration company.
In the future, everyone should search on Baidu when choosing, and check these consultations because the renovation is not a small amount of money.
If you want to ask the merchant, please log in or register first.
Forbidden to publish various forms of merchant reviews, please refer to the declaration of merchant listing
Kunming 360 integrated home decoration channel provides you with the latest merchant information, such as address, telephone, business hours, etc. If you want to find a decoration company or decoration company, you can go to Douban.
This is so scary, please cancel the order within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Okay, then don't cancel the dialogue. If you don't return my money within 5 to 10 days, I will pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes
The fried chicken should be cooked, but the one received is raw meat, which can't be eaten
The Starry Sky Has an Appointment | The Geminid Meteor Shower Will Peak on the 14th - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (reported by Zhou Runjian) - A group of astronomical popular science experts introduced that the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe it after midnight on the same day.
An Qiu, an amateur astronomer in Beijing, captured the Geminid meteor shower on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai, China.
The parent body of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent body of the Pleiades meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "born" by comets.
Tianjin Astronomical Society Council Member and Astronomy Popularization Expert Shu Lianpeng introduced that just like the New Year's blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "screening period" can last from December 4 to December 17.
The Perseid meteor shower is known for its high density and stability, and is one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere along with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Geminid meteor shower.
One of the distinctive features of the Geminid meteor shower is that the speed of the meteorites is slow, the color is rich, and there are many fireballs. It is suitable for both visual observation and amateur astronomical photography.
Yang Jing, an amateur astronomer in Tianjin, took this photo of the Geminid meteor shower on December 13, 2020 in Tianjin, China.
According to the astronomical forecast, the Geminid meteor shower will reach its peak at around 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR of 150.
The Orionid Meteor Shower Recommendation Index Chart.
Last year, the Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be affected by the moonlight, so the brilliance will be slightly reduced.
November 11 is the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, and the lunar phase is a waxing gibbous moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, but fortunately the moon will fall in the later half of the night. At this time, the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will rise higher than usual.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe at night after the moon sets, but they should pay attention to keeping warm. "
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
“It is not advisable to observe in the city, but you can choose a place in the suburbs or countryside with a high altitude, low light pollution, and a view to the northeast, and then wait patiently after the moon has set to observe visually.
It should be noted that the flow rate of the Geminid meteor shower in all directions is very large, so you do not need to stare at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower all the time when observing.
Friends who like photography should choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens to shoot a spectacular “meteor shower ” film. When shooting, use high ISO and maximum aperture.
Tripods, spare batteries and cable releases are also essential for stability and continuity."
Xu Lianpeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the OP should be the liquid crystal TV, and the difference between the laser TV and the liquid crystal TV in terms of market positioning mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the comprehensive layout of the liquid crystal TV market, the laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or the laser TV itself is a product born for the large screen.
At present, the mainstream liquid crystal televisions are generally between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of laser televisions is generally above 75 inches, and the maximum is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the demand of users for large-screen color televisions.
In recent years, the shipment and sales volume of laser TVs have been increasing globally, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales volume of 80 inches and above.
According to CINNO Research, the sales volume of laser TVs will increase by more than 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason why it has such a good performance in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV, the laser light source does not directly enter the eye, and the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of natural objects than the backlight source of liquid crystal TV. The stimulation to the eye is also smaller.
The 144 sets of test data were obtained by the strict comparison between the laser TV and the liquid crystal TV under the same conditions of the population. The China Electronics Technology Standards Research Institute and the ophthalmology experts of the Beijing Friendship Hospital carried out the strict comparison between the laser TV and the liquid crystal TV under the same conditions of the population.
The data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have very strong eye-friendly characteristics, and in some respects even have a certain improvement effect.
In the age of increasing attention to eye health, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye-friendly advantages, but also opened up a new breakthrough point in the color TV market.
Secondly, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Unlike the price of liquid crystal televisions, the price of laser televisions currently sold on the market is mostly above RMB 10,000. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price will gradually rise.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
There's got to be some truth to that.
With the development of light source and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by liquid crystal TV and projector.
Thanks to the super-short focal length projection technology, the laser TV's projection distance is relatively shorter than that of traditional projection devices. It can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance, and the space required is not large, and the main machine is small, taking up very little space.
In terms of brightness, large-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat dissipation is lower, and the equipment consumption is small, so the service life of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, biomimetic screen, and other cutting-edge technologies, which can give users a more shocking viewing experience.
It is not a fake demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and cost-benefit ratio, laser TV is not the favorite of video players. If you want to enjoy both large screen and viewing environment, you can try it. There are advantages and disadvantages to everything. After weighing the pros and cons, we can make our own judgments. We should not be influenced by one-sided words.
In simple terms, ultra-wide-angle near-field projectors - laser TVs - have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors to get close to the screen, which goes against the best optical design.
To block some of the environmental light, use a micro-structured Fresnel screen, which is expensive, and the price of 80-inch is basically equivalent to that of a 65-inch LCD.
Another thing, I really hate when the projector manufacturers use the "reflected light is good for the eyes" as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is the direct light, even if it is reflected to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it, so the liquid crystal TV is also "reflected" direct light? Turn on the TV and the ceiling will also be illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not reflective, it will not become an image.
The hot spots (hot spots) of the high gain screen are ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Wenxue Visual Arts Photography Gallery Selects Quality Stores Temporarily Without Branches
After adding the WeChat reservation date, the little sister arranged the available time for me and replied to me in a timely manner.
Before going there, I looked at the shooting works in the store, which were mostly outdoor wedding dresses. The shooting was very beautiful, and there were many shooting styles involved.
After arriving on the day, I briefly exchanged my ideas with the little sister. She was very patient and helped me try two sets of clothes that I was confused about. In the end, we decided to start makeup and hairstyle. The photographer will arrange some props before shooting. He will also guide the action and pay attention to the details.
However, it may be because I did not communicate my specific shooting ideas with him, so the result was not what I wanted, but it should be good-looking 🙊🙊
After taking the photos, the photographer will help to select the photos and discuss the post-processing style. He is quite considerate.
It takes about half a month to repair the film. Waiting for the effect.
The second time I took part in a photo shoot for a buffet. Most of the clothes in the buffet were able to choose one piece to be photographed.
Finally, I chose a black chiffon skirt to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting is the younger brother of the 95 generation, and he feels a little shy. I hope that in the future, he will give more suggestions on the guidance of customer shooting actions. The shooting process is quite pleasant.
Wenxue Visual Arts Photography Gallery Selects Quality Stores and Responds
Go to the home page and check out Queenie, too.
When I went to the store, I first filled in my name and phone number, and then I could choose clothes and wedding dresses. I tried on three or four sets of clothes, which was very patient. After that, I was made up for a long time, and the service attitude was also good. After that, the shooting will teach you how to pose, but the feeling is that your face is big, and the retouching said that it would take half a month, but it only took three or four days to send it over, and it felt like there was no difference to the original film.
Environment: Overall, it's not too bad.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are about three make-up positions, and there is a photography studio in the middle.
The service is very friendly and attentive.
The hairstylist is very patient.
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching you the moves.
If the photographer is not satisfied, he will proactively ask for a retake.
【Experience】The eyelid may be a little too much, and the original double eyelid was pasted out as a triple eyelid.
The eyebrows were also shaved, which was a bit embarrassing for those who do not draw eyebrows on a daily basis.
The photos were given to me within a few days, but I was not satisfied with the P-taking effect, and I felt that the double eyelid tapes were still very obvious.
Because I didn't know what kind of style I wanted, I tried two sets and finally chose the black dress. The lady said that this set was more of a Audrey Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to make up. The hairstylist and makeup artist were very patient in helping me make up. I was very satisfied with the effect.
After makeup and hairstyle, I started taking photos. The photographer guided me to pose throughout the process. The process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After the shooting, I carefully selected four photos that I liked the most, and the little brother said that the photos inside were all good, and the ending was very satisfactory.
I have not received a reply for 3 days... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card every time I pay.
I have to pay the shipping fee every time.
Can I get a waiver first, and then pay my monthly fee once your investigation is complete?
Is it safe to buy umbrella insurance?
Xiaoyu Umbrella is an insurance agency platform for the Internet.
From the perspective of setting conditions: according to the suggestion of the Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015), in order to become an insurance brokerage institution, three key words must be met: the shareholders and founders must have no major violations of the law in the past three years, the minimum amount must be RMB 500 million, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, these three are very strict. In summary, it is necessary to have the ability, to be approved by the national authority of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (regulates all insurance companies in China), and the shareholders must have a good reputation. As a small umbrella insurance provided by the insurance agency, the insured does not need to question whether the small umbrella insurance is regular or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, and not all insurance companies can meet them.
In this regard, it is not bad, and it is worthy of trust.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform. For example, the latest Super Mary 5 Critical Illness Insurance of Anda Life Insurance Co., Ltd. is sold on this platform. Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to doubt its reliability.
From the mode of payment: the products of the Internet platform are because of the lack of the cost of the operation of the outlets and the cost of the salary of the business personnel, so the products of the Internet generally have a relatively high price-performance ratio, and the mode of payment is flexible, and supports monthly payment, which can relieve the pressure of the payment of the insured person to the greatest extent, and at the same time can maximize the lever of the insurance.
That's pretty good.
Consider it.
From the professionalism of the agent: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry that requires a high degree of professionalism, and many Internet product customers can themselves purchase insurance. This will inevitably lead to a lot of misconceptions in health disclosure and occupation, and non-insurance professionals will often add their subjective ideas when purchasing insurance, thinking that they are healthy or meet the requirements, which will inevitably lead to a lot of claims denial risks.
I myself have done insurance phone sales for "Tencent Micro Insurance" (which is also an Internet insurance agency platform), and I am very responsible for telling you.
Insurance on the Internet is real and reliable, but unreliable is the people, and the Internet channel does not have professional personnel, and there are many sales misdirection.
For example: 1 yuan insurance for 6 million yuan, buy insurance and get a mobile phone for free, free to receive 60,000 yuan of critical illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are superficial, they will not tell the policyholders that the first month is 1 yuan, and the second month is charged according to normal rates, ranging from a few tens to 200 yuan, and many customers do not know what they are buying.
They thought they could get insurance for 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 6 million yuan (a piece of cake).
Free mobile phones are only sent to special policy numbers, such as 6666 and 8888. If the winning text message is sent, and you do not exchange it, no one will remind you.
For the insured, this is another pitfall. Free to get 60,000 RMB of critical illness insurance is short-term. If you only rely on this, without any other commercial insurance, what can 60,000 RMB do if you get critical illness? It will not be able to solve the problem. From now on, your life will be naked.
Currently, the state is also vigorously cracking down on the misleading of Internet insurance sales.
So, overall, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
Suggest that the topic owner should comprehensively consider it. In fact, many offline insurance agencies have more products. Customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products have better cost-benefit ratios than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers to insure their offline products, saving RMB2,000-3,000 per person per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
I: an insurance broker with 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, I have served more than 1,000 enterprise users, and I have cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing insurance, I will start from the needs of customers and customize insurance products for customers. During the purchase, I will compare three insurance companies for customers and try my best to get the best underwriting results for customers. After purchasing insurance, I will help customers organize their insurance policies, manage their insurance policies, and let customers feel at ease and worry-free.
To grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the OP.
According to the definition of the insurance regulator, the Internet insurance is the insurance business that the insured person can complete all the insurance procedures independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured person does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the insured person independently.
Although there is no "ceremony" for online insurance registration, and it may even be that there is no printed contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to "phone sales" in general, but such a way of buying insurance will also have a fatal problem, that is, the after-sales service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for several decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is a "long-term insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us in many years later?

No problem, no need to arrange re-delivery, I have bought another one, don't want to waste
Thank you for your help
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of defamation and abuse, and I will not tolerate this kind of personal attack.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must not tolerate this kind of scumbag.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing we should resist is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From the moment you started sending friend requests on Facebook, to the moment you started posting jokes, to the moment you tried to post the alleged location of my house and my father's name on social media, I've taken a no comment approach.
You continued to tag me relentlessly, not only at the frequency of six meals a day, but also on Facebook with your so-called friends to continue to discuss about me some obscene, humiliating remarks about my appearance, body shape, good living habits, strawberries on the bed, whether to insert or not, and so on, I...
How do I know that later, I received messages from more friends about your Facebook friend account uploading a photo of you with sexual harassment content.
As a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After the news of my reporting the police, you became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, and I don't care what your identity or status is. In our society, we need to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue with the jokes, the innuendo, the humiliation, the insults, the harassment. You can continue to say you're just concerned and caring about me, you can continue to say it's not harassment, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say it's not your fault, you can continue to say
No, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to comment on my appearance and body.
I don't even think there's a girl out there who would be willing to put herself through that kind of humiliation just to get famous.
A friend asked me how I was doing.
I said I wouldn't, and you wouldn't believe me.
I don't think any girl would be able to say she's fine after being bullied like that.
Whether in the workplace, in society, in politics or in business, only those without any basic decency would choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe justice will prevail.
I have selected some of the comments for you to judge.
No one should be able to impersonate you on your own posts, right?
All I can say is that you are an enemy of civilization.
A hearty laugh.

The topics of the meetings were around digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and post-epidemic economic recovery and development.
Mr. Nguyen Manh Hung, Minister of Information and Communications, said that in 2021, although the COVID-19 epidemic continued to spread, the number and revenue of Vietnamese digital technology enterprises still maintained a growth trend of nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam has increased, and many digital products have left the country, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has been improved.
Mr. Nguyen Manh Hung, Minister of Planning and Investment, called on digital technology enterprises to shoulder the responsibility of developing the digital transformation platform of developing countries, and the task of developing these countries' digital platforms is to shoulder the national mission.
At the forum, the leaders of the ministries and agencies, enterprises, organizations, and individuals who are researching, developing, applying, and transferring digital technologies shared their ideas and solutions to mobilize and gather resources from all sectors of society to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, work together to promote the digital transformation of the country, and find breakthroughs and solutions to post-epidemic economic recovery and other issues.
At the forum, Premier Feng Mingzheng stressed that digital transformation is the inevitable path of the world and the objective need for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation serves the people, so it needs to mobilize the people to participate.
The people and enterprises are the core, main body, goal and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be for the people and enterprises.
Premier Feng Mingzheng stressed that the digital transformation should reflect the national spirit. It should be based on the internal force, the strategy, the long-term and decisive factors, and the external force as the important and breakthrough point.
At the same time, he believes that digital transformation should drive the development of depth and sustainability, participate in the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, economic recovery and development, overcome the changes after the epidemic, and help green transformation and development of green energy.
Digital transformation needs to participate in the construction of databases related to national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs, and national landscapes, and promote the digital transformation of banks, taxation, land management and development, and logistics.
The ultimate goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and make the country more prosperous.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh requested that all levels of governments, agencies and enterprises should increase their leadership and guidance in developing digital technology, raise their awareness of digital transformation, continue to formulate and perfect the institutional framework for digital transformation, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises in the spirit of respecting, communicating, listening and being proactive and positive.

The high-speed rail residence
Address: No. 555, North 1st Road of High-speed Railway
There are relatively complete household appliances and electrical appliances here. There are many brands and famous brands.
During the Double 12, I went to Hanson's water purifier store to see the water purifier, and there was a promotion in the store. The price was relatively cheap.
There are a total of 11 floors in the Juzhou Home, the second and third floors are parking lots, and the first and second basements are also parking lots, and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are not very good, there are few hardware stores, and the taste of the restaurant is average.
This elevator is also very ridiculous. It is the same as having that big illness. It goes from floor 2 to floor 1 back and forth, and I kept pressing this floor. From the emergency exit to the first floor, it is also very ridiculous. It is directly connected to a furniture store. The furniture store is closed, and the emergency exit cannot be exited!
Joyous Home still needs to be improved. There are many places that have not been developed.
Address: No. 555, High-speed North 1 Road, Xayibake District. Convenient transportation, large parking lot, and free parking during the day.
Environment: To tell the truth, the store is quite large, with 8-9 floors. You can buy all kinds of furniture, household appliances, small things, etc. in the store. Many well-known brands have entered the store, such as MUJI, OPE, HUATAI, LORD, FENGCHENZHOU, HANSDTON, YACHT, YUFENG, FUPILU, WANJIALU, DAZHIXIAO, ZHONGLIAN, MIDE, YADAN, etc. The number of brands is really too many, and I can only remember so many. It is a good place to buy products. If you are tired, you can sit on the sofa and rest.
Recently, I wanted to buy a comfortable sofa. A friend told me that there are many sofas to choose from here, and I looked at the sofas of Rongchuang Home Furnishings and Meike Home Furnishings. I felt that they were okay, but they were a little expensive, so I was still in a dilemma.

The main stream of the Yangtze River achieves full coverage of green comprehensive service areas on water - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (reported by Wang Xian) - The Chongqing Yuzhong Water Green Integrated Service Area was officially put into operation on December 10. This is the second water green integrated service area on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Lushan Water Green Integrated Service Area in Lushan, Sichuan Province was officially put into operation on December 8.
With this, the water-based green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, said that before, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces had built and put into operation 10 green integrated service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by ship crews, and have played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The coverage of water green comprehensive service areas is another milestone event in the construction of green navigation on the Yangtze River. The reception capacity and service capability of ships in the Yangtze River have been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility to provide all-round production and living services for the ships and sailors, and to help the sailors solve the problems of “urgent, difficult, worrisome” issues.
The two water-based green integrated service areas built and put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River this time are a combination of living services, production services and government services, with green environmental protection as the main theme, with ship maintenance and ship emergency rescue services as the highlights, and realize that the ships docked in the harbor can provide multiple services, which will make the work and life of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and convenient.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon in the U.S. weapons warehouse has made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to the allies and enemies of the United States in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Sensing Platform, a Chinese think tank, on January 9, a satellite detected the USS Carl Vinson, a US aircraft carrier, in the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the First Island Chain in the West Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Carl Vinson" will deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft on the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier.
The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the USS Carl Vinson, is the USS Abraham Lincoln (USS Abraham Lincoln), which departed from the United States on January 3.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C carrier-based squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
Besides the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy also has the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier strike group also includes the guided-missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville and the guided-missile destroyer USS Stockdale.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon is rarely visiting Guam. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three U.S. aircraft carriers were gathering in the vicinity of China.
（South China Sea Strategic Situation Sensing） The three U.S. aircraft carriers gathered in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon rarely visited Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the U.S. Navy transport aircraft CMV-22B.
（South China Sea Strategic Situation Sensing Weibo）According to the report of CNN (CNN) on January 17, the most powerful weapon in the US Navy weapons warehouse paid a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The nuclear-powered Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers gathered in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon rarely visited the island of Guam. It is analyzed that this is a signal to the allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first time since 2016 that a U.S. ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam, and the second time since the 1980s that a U.S. ballistic missile submarine has made a public visit to Guam.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon is rarely visiting Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
The picture shows Yongxing Island in Nansha Islands, China.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine "Nevada" strengthened the cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region during its visit to Guam, demonstrated the United States' capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "boomers".
The whereabouts of the 14 Seawolf submarines in the U.S. Navy's submarine fleet are usually closely guarded secrets.
The secret around the ballistic missile submarine made "Thunderbolt Submarine" the most important survival weapon in the "nuclear triad" system, which also includes the missile launch site on the U.S. mainland and the B-2 and B-52 bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
Talking to friends about Meta's recent fall of 26% and the loss of $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that the company is "facing unprecedented competition." Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its main income comes from advertisements. Today, advertising companies that make money are those with their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, regardless of the functional positioning, are the traffic channels of Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance". Many apps are connected to Meta's advertising platform through Meta's advertising platform to realize monetization.
But the times, they are a-changin'.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta is no longer able to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users, and will clearly remind users whether to allow the app to obtain their own information. Most people's normal reaction is not to allow it.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, China's contribution to Meta's revenue growth in the past has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly from the contribution of Chinese companies doing overseas business.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about 1,000 people, and there are several agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel. Most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, now TT of ByteDance is one of Meta's main competitors, but two years ago, Meta could make a lot of money from ByteDance.
All the agents in China are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta, and the performance of Meta in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but I'm sure it's not better than before.
The stage of large-scale spending by Chinese companies overseas has already passed.
Thirdly, the expansion of new traffic channels has not been successful.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only looking at current income, but also looking at future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about "Metaverse".
The metaverse is definitely a direction for the future, but the realization period of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story is not enough to support Meta's market value in the next two or three years.
Therefore, in the next two years, Meta should be a relatively difficult period.
Don't be fooled by Facebook's glamorous appearance now, with annual revenue of 10 billion to 20 billion US dollars. In fact, Facebook is very worried now, and there is no good security barrier compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although the number of daily active users of his social software is relatively high, and it is a mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook has no confidence to disrupt, and it is only a blink of an eye.
Facebook is very dangerous because it has no chance of success in the short term, which is why Zuckerberg keeps changing the name of the company and keeps looking for new tracks. However, I think his track selection is wrong, and it is a dead end. The above is my thinking for reference.

The Joint Medical Assistance Exercise between the People’s Liberation Army and the Vietnamese People’s Army “Peaceful Rescue-2021” was successfully concluded - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 12 (周娜 滕怀金) At 10:00 am on December 12, all of the Chinese participating in the “Peaceful Rescue-2021” joint training of the Chinese and Vietnamese armies safely returned to China’s Guangxi region, marking the successful completion of the 7-day training mission.
This joint drill focused on the theme of humanitarian medical rescue, and the two armies carried out joint emergency command, joint on-site rescue, mass casualty treatment, and other tasks in accordance with the standard of combat readiness, effectively enhancing the joint emergency response capability of the two armies.
The results of the exercise have been recognized by both the Chinese and Vietnamese armies.
Ruan Xiongsheng, Chairman of the Exercise Guidance Committee of Vietnam and Deputy Director of the Logistics Department of the Vietnamese People's Army, said at the end of the exercise that the Vietnamese doctors learned a lot of knowledge about the organization and professional activities of the exercise from the Chinese doctors, and also saw the medical and support equipment of the Chinese.
The results of the exercise proved the professional capabilities of the medical forces of the two countries in medical assistance and epidemic prevention and control.
Chen Chunming, the head of the guidance and coordination group of the Chinese side and the deputy director of the Department of Health of the Logistics Support Department of the Central Military Commission, said that this exercise was another innovative practice based on the successful joint medical mission in 2018, and had great significance in terms of pioneering and innovation.
