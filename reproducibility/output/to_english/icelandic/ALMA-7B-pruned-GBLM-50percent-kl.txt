Shouting to the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland has got off to a good start and the howls and cries outside in nature are starting to tug at people far and wide.
She says, "You need me, I need Iceland," in a comment on an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the video-sharing website YouTube.
Another spectator says they will always keep Iceland in their hearts for all eternity and a young woman says she has to get to Iceland as soon as possible because her boyfriend is living there.
Unfortunately, she's in the U.S., which means she'll have to wait even longer.
Another spectator asks if the path to Iceland is passable, since there are no planes.
It is not clear whether he comes from another time zone.
Egill Þórðarson from the advertising agency Peel, which came up with the advertisements together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the response has been better than expected.
I've been involved in many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been very successful, but this new campaign is already off to a great start.
At its core, it's about creating PR value, that is to get foreign media to talk about the campaign, and that has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in over 700 media outlets around the world, totaling over two billion people.
The value of the coverage is valued at ISK 1.8 billion.
It's not amalegt."
The main market has always been the United States and the campaign has gone very well there, despite the fact that the United States are not on their way to the country.
According to Egill, known markets such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also taken well to them, as has Russia, which comes as a pleasant surprise.
Then came reactions from distant areas, such as India, which was not given special attention.
These ads have traveled farther than we expected," Egill says, noting that more than four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
We couldn't have asked for a better start."
The pictures on this opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, a photographer for Morgunblaðið, while he was taking photographs for advertisements with the title "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
Filming took place widely, such as on Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík, in Reynisfjöru, at Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökli, and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfða.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti productions and the cameraman was Óttar Guðnason.
The Icelandic actors Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary, were in the roles.
Dozens of Icelanders were involved in the making of the advertisements, while at the same time as filming was taking place in the south of the country, another group was filming in the west of the country.
According to Egill, "Let It Out" is only the first phase of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, with a winter campaign planned in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic Tourist Board," Egill says, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone very well.
It's great to work with them.
In such projects it is crucial to have foreign partners with expertise in the markets we are talking about."
Sprengisandur: Discussion of the situation on the labour market, the pension system and much more
Icelandic: Ásmundur Einar Daðason, the social and child welfare minister, will appear on Sprengisand, which starts at ten on Bylgjunni today.
He is also the labour market minister and talks about the situation on the labour market, the Icelandair case and other cases.
He also discusses regional issues and the transfer of jobs out to the countryside, which has been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, will also appear in the programme, and he will discuss his criticism of pension funds' investments and will put forward ideas about how labour movement and employers should withdraw from the boards of the pension funds in order to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then Ivar Ingimarsson, tourism manager in the East, and Árnheiður Jóhannsdóttur, director of the Markaðsstofu Norðurlands, will discuss the situation in tourism on the countryside.
They will look ahead to autumn and ponder whether the summer's prosperity is a harbinger of what is to come.
You can listen to the show here, and it starts at 10 a.m.
This is how she looks today, 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teen-oriented shows.
However, she became famous for her role as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills, 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
She hasn't been in the news much lately, but she did get to talk about Clueless on Australian television a few days ago.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a great person.
I have to admit that I based the character on girls I knew in school who weren't very nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this person was," Donovan said about his role in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave police station after night shift
Fifty cases were reported to the police in the capital area today, and according to the police's daily report, the cases were varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to deal with a man who had just been released from a detention cell after having been detained for intoxication.
The man didn't want to leave after he was released and didn't comply with police instructions to leave.
The man won his continued stay at the police station on account of his conduct.
That morning, a man was arrested on suspicion of breaking into a company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to deal with two men in Breiðholt in connection with a report of assault.
Additionally, a woman who was eating in a shopping mall in Kópavogur was unable to pay her bill at the end of the meal and was subsequently called to the police.
There was also a theft of a car in the city centre in the morning.
The driver of a white Renault van was looking for her at the time and she was taken by force.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Glitterati - Horrific Fate of the Glitterati
The theory has taken flight on the Internet that a curse hangs over the Glee cast, with the actress Naya Rivera drowning in California earlier this month and becoming the third main cast member to die prematurely.
The Glee series is a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The series dealt with a so-called teenage cheerleader squad at a high school, their loves and fates.
It wasn't always taken out with glee to be a part of the band, but through song and dance, the characters of the show seemed to overcome the circumstances of their lives.
Outside the studio, disaster has struck the cast and crew of the show, so much so that theories have emerged that the show is cursed.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez, a cheerleader who didn't call all her aunties.
After the show had run its course, Rivera went on to have a child with actor Ryan Dorsey, his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against a man and they split up afterward.
Dorsey refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8 last month, Rivera was reported missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on the Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found asleep in a life vest aboard the boat, and he was able to tell law enforcement officials that he and his mother had gone into the water and that Rivera had returned him to the boat, but he never made it back.
Rivera's disappearance prompted a wide-ranging search.
The day after the search began, the area's sheriff announced that it was being conducted with the assumption that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially declared dead.
It is believed that she was swept into a strong current in the water and used her last strength to save her sons.
The cause of death was alcohol intoxication.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson, the American football player with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Glee Club to prominence.
Outside of the show, Moneith was battling personal demons.
From the age of 13, he struggled with addiction and found it difficult to get away from it.
In 2013, his co-stars grew tired of his antics and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith underwent treatment and seemed to be on the road to recovery.
Just two months after completing treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out with friends.
The cause of death was a combination of drugs and alcohol.
It was not considered to be an act of malice.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for drugs had diminished so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death weighed heavily on his co-stars, but thanks to the insistence of his co-star, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue the series and dedicate it to the memory of Moneith and his character, Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman on the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and didn't have much respect for his fellow Glee club members, until he gained the courage to admit he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of possession of child pornography.
During a search of his home, a huge amount of child pornography was found, and the matter quickly became public.
It was clear that Salling was done.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his crimes.
He was sentenced to four to seven years in prison, in addition to having to register as a sex offender and seek treatment for child sexual abuse.
Before the judge had decided on the punishment, Salling, who was out on bail at the time, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
Not only did the cast of the show pass away long before their time.
Jim Fuller was the associate producer of the show.
He died suddenly in his sleep in 2013, aged just 41.
A woman named Nancy Motes also worked on the show.
She was the younger sister of the Hollywood star, Julia Roberts, and did not share her sister's glamorous story, but accused her sister of high-handedness and bad manners.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé, in which she blamed her mother and sister for how she was treated.
My mother and so-called siblings get nothing from me but the memory of the fact that it was they who caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and harassing her co-stars on set and having an overbearing star complex.
Jesse Luken guest-starred in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged for drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a big scandal.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
In 2010, she became the victim of hackers who stole her sexually explicit images and posted them online.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the show and had a relationship outside of the show.
Benoist later claimed that Jenner had abused her during their relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
It enhances children's development when they are allowed to play in the garden with their parents and watch the flowers grow and flourish.
It is also endless what you can do with flowers, as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just being able to spend time with the kids in the garden is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the smell, and of course the precious time they got to spend with their parents.
Bought a boat after tenth grade
I don't think there are many sailors working in kindergartens in Iceland," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who works as a fisherman during the summer and is studying psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter."
Sea fishing is a very pleasant summer job when you are in school.
If the fishing is good, it's possible to make good money and it's great that I don't have to take student loans.
The income also covers me through the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, 25-year-old psychology student, who has been engaged in beach fishing for the past few summers.
Axel was docked at Tálknafjörð when the journalist spoke to him late at night at the beginning of the week."
The winter I was in tenth grade, I took my boat captain's license for boats under 12 meters and I bought my boat the summer after I finished high school.
I have been engaged in beach fishing on my boat every summer since then.
I bought the boat used by a friend of mine, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat after him.
By the time I bought the boat, Hartmann was an adult and no longer at sea, and he was very happy to see that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," Axel says, adding that he bought the boat for three million crowns.
I made a deal with Hartmann that I would pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, but the other half at the end of the summer when I was done fishing.
I had the boat debt-free at the end of my first summer on it."
How could a boy have $1.5 million to pay for a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
I had been saving up and gathering money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was working with him every summer and I got my share.
I also put my confirmation money into my boat fund."
Axel was born in Isafjord, where all his mother's family live, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
I can fish here in the Westfjords because I have my residence permit with my grandmother in Isafjord.
I learned about these areas here to the west from rowing with my dad.
I move from fjord to fjord depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all of Westfjord.
Although I prefer to be on the west side, I have also worked around Snæfellsnes and elsewhere.
I've also fished for cod in the south," says Axel, who always goes out fishing early in the morning and says he sometimes talks to the gulls and sings for the heavens, in his solitude hours together on the ballarhafi.
The internet connection out at sea is good, so I can call, listen to podcasts and music.
I don't mind being alone on a boat.
Of course I try to avoid getting into trouble, but of course there have been times when the weather has been bad, but never any great danger," says Axel, who is lucky that he is not prone to seasickness.
He says the length of the working day varies according to how the fishing goes each time.
I am never more than 14 hours at sea fishing at a time, but I have also been fishing in other systems, such as the quota leasing system, where I have been out at sea continuously for one and a half days at a time.
The arrangement for coastal fishing, he says, is such that he can catch 770 kg per day, which he finds hampering.
Other restrictions are that I may not fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I may only fish for twelve days in a month, these four months when coastal fishing is allowed, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days based on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to row in place of having 48 days over the entire summer and be able to choose according to their fancy.
So could the regionalisation also go my way and the fishing ports that are well located in the fishing grounds should be able to benefit from that," says Axel, who mainly draws cod from the salty sea on his coastal fishing trips, but also catches a few other species.
Axel works through the winter with his university studies at the kindergarten Núpi in Kópavogur.
I don't think there are many sailors working in kindergartens," Axel is proud and adds that he only planned to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
I got stuck there because I love my job.
I hope that the psychology will be useful to me on the preschool level in the future," Axel says, who is also far along in his studies in commerce.
Villa in registration prevents home quarantine
The villa on the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country became the reason that an individual who was living in the country was not called back for a test.
There is no requirement to register a national identity number if the person completes the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
This will be looked at in the coming week, says an infectious diseases expert at the Office of the Chief Medical Officer.
Three domestic transmissions were detected at the Institute of Virology at Landspítalinn yesterday.
One of those who tested positive arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the country's quarantine rules went into effect.
Those who were resident in Iceland are then screened upon arrival in the country and again called in for testing four to five days later.
It was reported in the midday news on RÚV that the person in question had followed the old rules.
The screening at the border was negative and he was not called back for testing for the virus.
State epidemiologist Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir says in an interview with the news agency that this can be traced back to an error in the electronic registration form.
Filling out the registration form in English is not a prerequisite to entering a national identity number, as it is in the Icelandic version.
After all, it was first and foremost aimed at foreign tourists.
The person in question did not receive an automatic invitation to come in for a test.
Kamilla says many have followed the quarantine rules even though they filled out the English form and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people back for another test after they arrive in the country.
This will be looked at in the coming week to see how it can be made easier for people to access this and raise awareness of the process."
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all went in for a test, but two were showing symptoms.
Sentinel surveillance is now underway for the three cases identified yesterday, but it is mostly complete for the two cases identified on Friday.
In both cases, Icelandic genomics has revealed that there is a deviation of the coronavirus that has not been found here before.
In the second case, the bands have been directed at Israel, even though it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should be clear by tomorrow where the virus is coming from.
So far, 15 people are in isolation according to the COVID.is website.
135 people are in isolation.
Four of the five cases were unrelated.
Five domestic infections have been detected in Iceland in recent days.
Of these four, four are completely unrelated, and it is, for example, not yet known where the infection came from at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday.
Sentinel surveillance is still ongoing.
Originally, 30 exceptionally sent people were quarantined, but their number was reduced to 16.
In total, 34 people are in quarantine due to these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that an infection has been detected at a sporting event and has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, communications manager for the National Police and Crime Agency, says it's possible as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
We are consistently reminding everyone who lives here of the need to maintain individual hygiene.
We also need to remind people who are organising events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
Then it is possible to hold events," says Jóhann.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by maintaining individual hygiene measures.
Rules and standards are being reviewed on an ongoing basis.
What needs to be done, and what the Almannavarnardeild and the Landlæknisembætti are constantly urging people to do, is to focus on these individual hygiene measures.
Both at home and at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use sanitizer.
It prevents the spread of infection," Johann says.
We need to urge people to continue on the good path that we were on, in order to keep up the progress that we have made so far.
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard how difficult it was for her father to breathe.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was let go.
The death was traced to acute respiratory failure due to a coronavirus infection.
Sugar diabetes was listed on the death certificate as an underlying condition and Brumfield, who also has sugar diabetes, is terrified that the same thing will happen to him.
Reuters reports that Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
The results of a new study conducted by U.S. authorities show that nearly 40% of those who died were suffering from type 2 diabetes.
When the proportion of those under the age of 65 is considered, the proportion rises to half.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) investigated more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died of the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an expert in infectious diseases at the CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
The Reuters poll, which surveyed the 12 countries that responded to a similar poll, showed a similar trend.
Ten countries, including California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet reporting underlying illnesses.
Sugar diabetes was already an epidemic.
COVID-19 has broken out like a tsunami," Reuters quotes Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Sugar diabetes is more common among blacks and people of Latin American heritage, which have also been hit harder by the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease in check with exercise, a healthy diet, and help from health professionals.
The coronavirus pandemic has, however, made it difficult for many to stick to their routines.
The high price of insulin has forced some to continue working and avoid exposure to the virus.
Reuters points out that U.S. authorities should have been aware of the danger posed by people with type 2 diabetes.
In the SARS epidemic of 2003, nearly 20% of those infected had the disease, and in the swine flu epidemic of 2009, this group was three times more likely to need hospital care.
When MERS hit in 2012, one study found that 60% of those who died or were hospitalized had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because of the longer-lasting effects of COVID-19, the pandemic may have removed the veil from a larger number of previously unknown complications.
I am afraid we will see a tsunami of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, president of the International Diabetes Federation.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic could indirectly lead to an increase in complications associated with diabetes, such as kidney disease and kidney failure.
New research suggests that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in cases of diabetes.
Scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes, Reuters reports.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already compromised by many people with diabetes.
The high proportion of glucose and lipids in the blood of diabetics can trigger a genuine immune storm, as it is called when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelium can also cause swelling, which can lead to dangerous blood clots.
This is all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
It's all interconnected."
The story has been corrected.
We were offered champagne, and then they left the room."
Artist Ragnar Kjartansson asked the couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason to have sex in front of a camera for a work he was setting up in Paris.
We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."
Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and mother-in-law, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
I was very impressed by her.
It was just the natural glow, but I also thought it was really sweet.
And it still feels that way," he says.
Asrún remembers this as well, since her husband regularly brings up the first meeting.
I'm always hearing this story.
Just last weekend," she says, who was also attracted to her husband at first sight.
I felt and still feel so much hype around Atli, which I like.
There's a lot going on and a lot happening, and I'm fascinated by it."
Atli says that the couple have emphasized going their own way in their relationship.
We don't tie our baggage in the same knots as fellow travellers.
We avoid routines that we identify around us."
There may be a reason why they took Ragnar Kjartansson's artist's proposal only with enthusiasm, though it was far from usual.
Kristín Anna, our common friend, has contacted us and asked whether we can come to eat dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg, Ragnar's wife.
They accepted the invitation, met the triumvirate at Snaps, and got themselves a dessert wine and each their own dessert.
They listened to Ragnar as he led them through his plans for an art exhibition he intended to set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris this autumn.
He had a marathon video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
He explained it in a simple way."
Ásrún says he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from everyday life of Westerners.
He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and the last thing he said was that he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part."
Senan, which Ragnar asked the couple to take part in, was supposed to show a young middle-class couple falling in love in a minimalistic apartment.
This is foreplay with a beginning and an end," says Atli.
The couple didn't know much about Ragnar, although they knew of him and he knew of them "but they knew us and felt we fit in.
They said they didn't want to advertise for people.
Perhaps they thought that they wouldn't get the right people, but people who would get sexual gratification from performing for others."
They greeted Ragnar and agreed to think about the matter, but it didn't take long.
When we walked out of Snaps we said: Aren't we just having fun?
That was just the way it was.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his whole team," Ásrún says, and Atli nods in agreement.
It's all about love and intimacy."
Senan was filmed in a fine apartment on Mýrargötunni.
There was a very small film crew; the cameraman, Ragnar and sound man and the couple.
After the recording was started, everyone left the room to wait outside in the car, except Atli and Ásrún.
We weren't sure what we were going to do.
We received some guidance, but we tried to forget time and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There wasn't any playing, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," Ásrún says.
Was this romantic?
Yes, it was a bit romantic," says Atli, and Ásrún agrees.
They were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on holiday at a posh hotel in Paris."
The team were impressed by the performance of the pair in the piece that moved them.
When photographer Tommi saw this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.
This is as much about love and intimacy as it is about the act itself, says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and says Atli that his mother heard the voice of the son in the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
Then she turns around and starts to ponder this," Atli says.
Mum and Dad saw this in Paris.
We didn't say anything about it, but then dad sent me a message and said: It's nice to run into the little family in Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún remembers.
And did the participation in the work deepen the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
At least we're still together, so maybe it's a bit deeper than that.
At the very least, this deepened my relationship with my extended family," Ásrún says, laughing.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleagues.
I found it a bit difficult not to be with you, rather than someone else," she says, turning to her husband.
But it was fun to see it because it's just one scene in a much bigger work and when you see it with the other works it's very cool.
I could sort of detach myself from this and be proud.
And there was a little bun in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the scene was filmed.
It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to Ásrún and Atli in Astarsögur on Rás 1.
Swansea win first leg of the semi-finals
Swansea won a 1-0 victory against Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game between the two teams in the semi-finals of the promotion to the English Premiership.
The match took place at Swansea's home in Wales.
The score at half time was 0-0.
Home fans in Swansea were awarded a penalty at the 64th minute but Andre Ayew failed to score from the penalty spot.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, received a red card.
Brentford played the remainder of the game with 10 men and on 82 minutes Swansea took advantage of their numerical advantage.
Andre Ayew made up for his penalty miss by scoring a fantastic goal and securing Swansea's 1-0 victory.
Swansea leads the tie 1-0 going into the second leg at home to Brentford on Wednesday.
Five-year sendiherralaust from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted to hire an armed bodyguard because he feared for his life.
However, it has not been an easy task for the U.S. president to appoint an ambassador to Iceland.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as U.S. ambassador in April 2009, there has been no U.S. ambassador in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under peculiar circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falck Medal.
While on her way to a farewell ceremony with the president, she received a phone call from the presidential office informing her that she would not be awarded the title.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations at the U.S. Army War College.
It took six months for Van Voorst's successor to arrive, in September 2010.
To some extent, it can be traced back to Robert S. Connan having been appointed as an ambassador, but then resigning.
Finally, Louis Ariega, who had worked in the foreign service for decades, took over the job.
He resigned his post in the autumn of 2013 and took up the position of ambassador in Guatemala.
This was followed by another sendiherralaust period.
Robert Barber was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in January 2015 and took office shortly thereafter, making him the first U.S. ambassador to be stationed in 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not diplomatic, and had worked as a lawyer and short-term campaign fundraiser for Barack Obama.
He resigned his post as soon as Donald Trump took office as president on January 20, 2017, as is customary with political appointed ambassadors.
Trump's administration was unusually long to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in the government.
It took two years for the U.S. Congress to call Jeffrey Ross Gunter to its committee to ask him questions and confirm him as U.S. ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony before the court, he said that he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, and his wife, who is deceased, was of Dutch origin.
Gunter is politically appointed, having been a dermatologist in California and prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson founded the group, and Adelson is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, when no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest such period ever recorded in Iceland.
The reason is both the length of time it took Trump to nominate people to key positions and the fact that work in the U.S. Congress has dragged on for a long time, including the confirmation of ambassadors.
Since 2009, the country has been without an ambassador in Iceland for over five years.
However, this has not prevented the Foreign Ministry from carrying out its projects, which opened its headquarters at Engjateig not long ago.
The construction is said to have cost around $6.5 billion, with bullet-proof walls surrounding the building and bullet-proof glass in all the windows.
However, it does not seem to be enough to fill the current ambassador's sense of security, as he is said to fear for his life and has asked for an armed bodyguard.
A former IBV player was subjected to racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former player for ÍBV, says he experienced racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This comes from an interview with Tonny that appeared in the Ugandan newspaper Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, who play in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Iceland, where he played with ÍBV, Valur and Þróttur.
When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle like I was used to playing.
The team captain was in that position and, in addition, he also had the jersey number that I wanted, so I didn't get either of those things that I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right wing with ÍBV during the season.
One of the things Tonny talks about is racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
This happened to me once, but because I didn't understand the language, I ignored what was said to me.
Later, I found out more about the case, and then I asked my friend what the case was about.
He told me that my opponent made racist remarks about me after I tackled him."
In 2014 Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He says that was the mistake he regrets the most.
Tonny had not managed to get into the starting line-up at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
He then asked to go back to Iceland on loan, and he then joined Val.
It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been in Norway for a longer period of time, I would have gotten the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, who hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would go further.
He claims that the loan to Iceland has put an end to his dreams of playing in the big leagues in Europe.
A worm was found in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-inch black worm in a woman's throat.
The doctors were able to extract the worm using tongs.
The investigation revealed that a parasite was involved.
CNN reports this.
The woman had eaten sashimi, which are thin cuts of meat, a few days earlier.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, and parasites like this are often found in raw meat or fish.
The number of cases where people have been infected by parasitic worms has increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is about to start in Europe
Spain is now in the spotlight in terms of concerns about another wave of the coronavirus pandemic in Europe, where authorities have taken action to curb the spread of the coronavirus epidemic.
In Catalonia, all leisure activities have been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action in response to the spread of the virus in Spain, with the UK requiring all arrivals from Spain to go into self-isolation, like Norway, and France warning against travel to Spain.
The number of infections is also increasing in France and Germany, where authorities are trying to find a balance between containing the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
While the situation in Europe is still good compared to other places in the world, the new number of infections worldwide is approaching 300,000 per day, with the highest number of infections in America and South Asia.
The number of confirmed cases worldwide has risen to 16 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University, and the number of deaths that have been confirmed to be linked to the virus has risen to 644,000.
Gerð's mosaic work finally gets its due
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavik, there is a large and deep hole.
Men in orange helmets can be seen above her.
There is also a large grave.
And more smaller work machines.
The road is closed to traffic.
The sidewalk is smooth, and now many people are standing there and admiring the artwork made of millions of mosaic tiles - as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At the very least, it did not take that into account.
So far, the project has been somewhat hidden, right in front of it were parking spaces that were always occupied.
People parked there, locked their car in a hurry, and then rushed off to carry out their errands in the city centre.
A "lively and diverse public realm" and "an inviting urban atmosphere" are the guiding principles in the redevelopment of Tryggvagatan, which is currently underway.
The aim is to beautify the area and allow Gerðar Helgadóttur's mosaic at the Customs House to be seen better.
A plaza will be built in front of the work, and since the area is well exposed to the sun, it is thought to be suitable as a resting area for travellers.
The artwork will be illuminated and the materials will be allowed to take center stage on this 142-square-foot space.
There will also be small "mist puddles," or water sculptures, that offer play and provide a certain mystique to the area.
This is described by Reykjavikurborg, which is carrying out the project in cooperation with Veitur.
Water, heating and electricity networks will be renewed.
Many of them are in their 80s, but the drainage and cold water pipes are from 1925 and have served the city's residents and businesses for almost a century.
When the road is reopened after construction, cars will be able to drive on it again.
However, it will become a one-way street and at the same time create a calmer and more accessible space for pedestrians.
According to information about the Customs House on the tollstjóri's website, the building was taken into use in 1971, and the architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because the breakwater reached through the house, a 250-square-metre windowless wall was formed out onto the street.
The building committee and architect were in agreement that such a flat would have a detrimental effect on the overall street image, unless special measures were taken to enhance the appearance of the building.
The parties agreed that it would be reasonable to assume that a permanent work of art would be installed there.
At this time, a lot was said about Gerður Helgadóttur, an artist, says in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic works in Germany and elsewhere.
It was advised that the first contact should be made with her before deciding whether a competition would be held for the work.
Often it had been discussed that the work needed to reflect life at the harbour, since the harbour had been the lifeblood of Reykjavik since it was built.
When the artist was interviewed, she became fascinated by such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country, where she would work on the drawings abroad.
Gerður had the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home she put forward a few proposals for discussion.
It was agreed without hesitation to ask her to do the work.
In addition, it was requested that a comprehensive agreement be made with her and the famous art restoration company in Germany, the Oidtmann brothers, as Gerður had long worked with them in the mounting of famous works of art all over Europe.
Negotiations went well and Gerður won the commission for the artwork, which was then installed at the workshop of the brothers, who then took care of the installation of the Customs House.
All aspects of the case were handled exceptionally well, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, according to the summary.
It has stood the test of harsh Icelandic weather.
It took Gerði two years to complete the work, which was completed and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the completion of Tollhúsverkið, at the age of 47.
Preparing the transfer of more institutions to the countryside
Agriculture Minister Ásmundur Einar Daðason has announced that more public institutions will be moved out to the countryside in the near future.
This was said by the minister on Sprengisandur on Bylgjunni at noon.
Recently, it was announced that the fire safety division of the Housing and Construction Agency will be moved to Sauðarkrók in the autumn.
Six fire safety experts work for the agency, but none of them intend to follow the agency north, and the State Fire Marshal's Association has criticized the relocation.
I think we need to take another step in this direction.
I am preparing to take further steps in this matter.
More deliveries," Ásmundur said.
He says he is convinced that a large majority of the country wants to see greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
I think more political decisions need to be made about moving public jobs out to the country, like I was doing with the Housing and Construction Agency," Ásmundur said. He also took the example of other agencies that have been moved out to the countryside, such as the Food Inspection Agency being moved to Selfoss, the Land Survey of Iceland being moved to Akranes, and the Unemployment Insurance Agency being moved to Skagaströnd.
All the latest news from the second day of the World Championships
The Icelandic Championships in track and field came to an end at Þórsvöllur in Akureyri today.
Several records were set on the second day of competition.
It was expected to be an exciting competition in women's javelin at Þórsvöll, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the Icelandic record in javelin in 2014, which stood until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR broke the record in May last year.
Vigdís regained the Icelandic record earlier this summer and has been in top form in recent weeks, having broken the Icelandic record three times this summer.
Elísabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and was not at her best today.
She had only one valid throw of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which was far from her best.
Vigdís threw the farthest today, 60.08 meters in her last attempt and set a meet record.
Her Icelandic record, set earlier in July, was 62.69 metres and she was well off that.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir of ÍR had the second best throw of the day, improving her best mark with a throw of 50.18 metres.
The FH athlete Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Iceland's champion in the javelin throw, won an easy victory in the men's competition. He threw 73.84 meters in his last throw and set a new competition record.
His Icelandic record in the event is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympic athlete and Iceland's champion in the javelin, won a competition in the hammer throw on Þórsvelli yesterday, but today he competed in the javelin, which is his main discipline.
Guðni Val's Icelandic record is 65.53 metres, but he threw 59.13 metres today to secure victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the furthest today, with one valid throw of 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Iceland's champion in the long jump, won the long jump competition with a clear advantage. Hafdís jumped the farthest, 6.25 meters, which is just short of the Iceland's record she holds.
In the women's 200m, it was IR's Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest, coming in at 24.04 seconds. Her national record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was successful in Akureyri, winning two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 metre run and in the 4 x 100 metre relay, and also in the 4 x 400 metre relay today.
Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson of FH was first in the men's 200 metre sprint with a time of 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samúelsson of Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 metre sprint and the 400 metre run.
No punishment for 27 million króna Bitcoin harvest
The tax appeals board has rejected a tax prosecutor's claim that a man should be fined for under-reporting his income from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The committee came to the conclusion that the tax prosecutor did not provide clear reasons for why it was necessary to prosecute the man.
In the ruling of the tax investigation committee, it is stated that the tax prosecutor believes that the man has fulfilled his obligation to pay taxes for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have overstated his income from cryptocurrency sales to $27 million, either intentionally or through gross incompetence.
The man would have been fined for his misconduct.
The man denied this in a letter to the committee.
However, he did manage to sell $27 million worth of cryptocurrency in 2016.
Hana would have been able to acquire him by grafting in the years 2009 and 2010, when grafting was both easy and inexpensive with a normal home computer.
He also pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the tax treatment of such a sale had been very unclear and unpredictable.
It would have been almost impossible to expect ordinary taxpayers to be aware of such arrangements on their tax returns.
He would not have intended to avoid paying tax on the harvest and would have made a declaration for his property as a deposit on a foreign currency account.
He had inquired with both experts and the tax office about this matter, but to no avail.
He also took into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to get to grips with complex rules that the tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion on.
The man believed that it was appropriate to recalculate his taxes for these two income years and to impose a burden on him, but otherwise he would not be punished.
He then reiterated that he was working in Iceland and had paid taxes here since 2012.
He would never have intended to evade his responsibilities in an improper manner.
The demand for compensation would be out of all proportion and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur raises eyebrows: "This man knows what football is all about"
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been somewhat between the teeth of people, but has also aroused admiration for his performance so far this season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max-deild.
Blikar will be in the firing line tonight when they take on ÍA in a live broadcast on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur is banned from playing for four warnings during the season and will not play with a new haircut as he has done in games so far this summer.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his forehead for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
I don't know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but in terms of character he was certainly trying in the game.
He did not go into hiding.
He wants the ball every single time and if someone was going to equal this game, I thought he was going to do it or make it," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max lounge, when the talk turned to Brynjólfur.
I'm supposed to be here for the people."
Sometimes it's hard to figure out what position he's in.
He looks a little to the left as the game goes on, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólfur is a genuine entertainer and is happy to have such a colourful man in the division: "No one disputes that this is a character.
She's a fun person and I love her hair, and being always ready for interviews.
There's an awful lot of people fascinated by him, which tells me that this man knows what football is all about.
I am an entertainer.
I'm here for the people and to have fun."
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólfur, people are paying their way in and watching what comes next on his head.
This guy is just a genius," Máni said.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in contact with several teams in the B-deild"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max-deild, seems to be on his way out of the club.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to go back to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the matter.
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country, but to do that he first needs to terminate his contract with KR, as the Danish league starts earlier than the Icelandic one.
The club knows that I miss Denmark and they have shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias said to Bold.
I've been in contact with a few teams in the B division and will likely make the switch before the end of the Icelandic season.
Not many teams in Denmark can afford to pay up my contract with KR."
He then says that he will probably have to take a pay cut in Denmark.
Companies in Denmark have probably felt more of an economic impact from the virus than in Iceland.
Bicycle thief Bjartmar has recovered bicycles for millions - Now responds to DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He steals and recovers lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned himself the nickname "the cyclist".
Yesterday, there was a lot of commotion when a man posted a story about his interactions with Bjartmar.
DV referred to the Vesturbær group on Facebook, where it was revealed that Bjartmar had taken the man to talk to on Austurvelli and said that the scooter might have been stolen.
There was nothing else to be read from the original writings of the rafskutl man but that Bjartmar had robbed him.
The text has now been altered on Facebook and the original DV headline has been updated to match that.
Bjartmar says the initial reports of the incident are not representative of what actually happened yesterday on Austurvelli.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victim of the electric scooter attack that these were indeed his electric scooter.
The information was given to the alleged owner by someone else, but the information turned out to be false, says Bjartmar.
I saw the fox and I recognized the trailer, since I had information that this trailer had been missing for a long time and that they were looking for it.
I hesitated for a moment, but when I saw him getting ready to drive off in the taxi, I decided to talk to him.
The owner was certain of his innocence, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
I'm generally very good at these sorts of things, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken the words away from me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter offered him a deal to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
Yeah, cool," said Bjartmar, "let's get this done."
The owner of the electric scooter then proved ownership of the electric scooter and drove off.
Later, the owner of the electric scooter told his story on Facebook, as previously reported.
In the short time that Bjartmar has been engaged in this practice, he says that he has been able to count the number of times he has ended up on the wrong side of people with his fingers on the other hand.
I have had peaceful interactions with the toughest men in Reykjavik," Bjartmar said, pointing out that bike thieves are usually the smallest brothers and sisters of society, junkies, the mentally ill and other people who are on the street for some reason or other.
“Drug addiction is a harsh landlord and somehow you have to pay for the next dose, unfortunately it is easy to steal money from such funds,” Bjartmar says.
My interactions with this group of people have been so good that I've been able to bring a lot of that good people with me.
There are examples of people going through treatment and taking themselves on and then coming to me and helping me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmar communicates with cyclists in a courteous manner.
Some people know about him and what he is doing and offer to show him receipts, registration numbers for bicycles, and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has not received much attention.
Bjartmar also says that the police are even going so far as to tell people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the previous reporting of DV and says that he is not some sort of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked whether he is not still on thin ice with his actions, and whether this is not primarily the task of the police, Bjartmar answers with certainty.
Of course the police should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are not doing this.
I have, for example, watched police drive away from a large pile of stolen bikes.
She is utterly clueless when it comes to these matters."
When the police are not doing anything about it, and this is right in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can achieve results in this field, then why not?", Bjartmar asks.
He claims to have achieved such a great success in stealing bicycles, that he sometimes runs into his "shelter seekers" on the street, where they have just stolen a bicycle.
The times that Bjartmar has called the police for help have resulted in her not showing up at all.
This just isn't working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the owners of the bikes' fault," Bjartmar said, and thinks it's unfortunate that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer for the inactivity of the police in this field.
There is no consensus about Bjarmar's achievements.
There are many stories of people thanking Bjarmar for getting their property back to them.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long ago given up counting the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts are probably in the millions, if not in the tens of millions.
Electric bicycles, electric scooters and electric trucks are heavy, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works at a preschool by day, and every other weekend he works at a boarding house.
His bicycle search is an unpaid labor he performs in his free time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a significant anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had been receiving pensions from the Danish king since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund for civil servants was established, which eventually became a pension fund for all public employees.
The foundation of the current pension scheme for ordinary wage earners was laid in 1969, when all-encompassing collective agreements were concluded on the labour market, which included provisions for an occupational pension scheme with compulsory membership and full-fledged pension accumulation from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, legislation was enacted on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to grow after that.
The pension system for workers was not the only radical change that the labour movement of the 20th century forced through with their struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been achieved by similar means in the famous labor disputes of 1955, and also the organizations had gradually gained their demands for sick leave and sickness benefits, substantial vacation rights, shorter working hours, improvements in housing conditions, and more.
All of these rights cost a great deal of hard work and struggle, but, in retrospect, proved to be far greater and more lasting than the increase in wages in the pay envelope, which disappeared as quickly as the price inflation that marked the period after the war and up to 1990, as many remember.
The lead-up to the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although men eventually came to agree that the funds would be in effect the property of the fund members, the labour movement had to accept that the boards of the funds would be composed of representatives of both employers and fund members.
Over the next few years after the founding of the funds, the demand for a majority of labourers in the boards of the funds was often discussed in the trade unions, but it never came to a vote, and so we are still sitting here with this unnatural arrangement that the representatives of the fund members are not in the majority in the boards of the funds.
In Article 36 of the Act No. 129/1997 on mandatory pension insurance and the operation of pension funds, provisions are made for the investment policy of the funds.
In the first paragraph, it says that "the pension fund shall have the interests of the pension fund members as a guideline."
Also, in 5th paragraph, it says: "A pension fund shall set ethical standards for their investments."
In the investment policy of the Lífeyrissjóður Verslunarmanna are, among other things, the following provisions, in addition to the previously mentioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and asset managers in North America and Europe.
The regulations cover how placing emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance, can contribute to better investment performance of mutual funds.
So go together the interests of investors and the goals of society in a broader context.
LV believes that it is important for companies, especially those listed on the stock exchange, to set themselves a public policy on: good corporate governance, fair remuneration and social responsibility.
The Icelandic pension fund Gildi, which has the largest pension funds in the country, has set itself a "responsible investment policy" and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all being recalled here as an introduction to the latest fashion word in Icelandic, "shadow management".
Since the word is new in the language, it is unlikely that it has been fully defined, but the following definition seems to be "the most common": Shadow management is when a union leader in a trade union says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the trade union to the board of a pension fund with instructions or instructions on how they should take a stand in a particular matter.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the first opportunity.
If the leader does not handle this in the media and does not talk about dismissal, then it is not "shadow governance" since such communications between people are, of course, always in the financial world and elsewhere.
I leave it up to the reader to decide which route he thinks is "shadowier."
There are two men who have tried to shape this definition when this is written, in the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are Fréttablaðið journalist Hörður Ægisson and Seðlabankastjóri Ásgeir Jónsson.
The reason for both was that Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the employment contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (firing them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of Verslunarmannafélag Reykjavíkur, sent out those demands to the representatives of the Lífeyrissjóður Verslunarmannafélag Reykjavíkur, that they should not support the purchase of shares in the company by the pension fund. Otherwise, they might be dismissed.
A little later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and in the wake of that, Ragnar Þór withdrew his demands, which were of course aimed at the decision of Bogi Nils.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to comment on the matter in Friday's edition of Fréttablaðið with large words about shadow governance, violations of the law, and a great need for changes to the law.
The little thrush certainly had to bear a heavy burden though the blessed thrush had been in a conjugal position and moreover had been dried out quickly.
Since the matter is important, let's focus on the substance itself at the end.
I went through the points in the law governing pension funds that relate to this matter.
This entails that the fund managers must look after the interests of the fund members and have ethical standards in their investments, and these aspects are further specified in the regulations of both Gildin and Lífeyrissjóður Verslunarmanna that I mentioned.
Pension funds, on the other hand, do NOT have to focus only on short-term profitability in their investments.
Such a policy would be highly dangerous and need not look far for examples of this in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have flowed to reckless adventurers and environmental vandals, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on thin ice when he thought it would be a good idea to lay off an entire group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill that Icelandair has enjoyed on the Icelandic market and weakening its position vis-à-vis investors.
Fortunately, he saw the error and withdrew it.
Time will tell whether it is sufficient to justify the pension funds' investment in the company being deemed responsible to the pension funds' members when all is said and done.

One of the infected did not observe home quarantine
One of the three who tested positive for Covid-19 in the country on Tuesday had arrived in the country from Estonia on July 15, just over a week ago.
He is an Icelander who is not living here on a permanent basis and therefore did not receive clear instructions on how to follow quarantine procedures upon arrival in the country and take another test a few days after arrival.
He received a negative result from the screening at the border.
But he is in the Icelandic society and in reality he should go to that solution," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert on the infectious diseases department at the Landlæknisembætti and deputy state epidemiologist while the epidemiologist is on summer vacation, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
He used the English registration form, and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the ID number is not registered, you are not automatically invited to the second test.
She says the man was able to use the English registration form because he was actually living abroad, but because of his ties to the country as an Icelander, he should have used the Icelandic form.
He didn't realize this.
If you don't register your ID number, you will have to go to the laboratory yourself to take the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realised that this was the right way to go," Kamilla says.
So it's clear that we need to strengthen the information-giving about this while we find a way to automate the booking system even though Icelanders don't register their ID numbers.
Or to make it more obvious who are the participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, the person in question did manage to get here despite the fact that he is considered to be a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
Only six were sent into quarantine after he was diagnosed yesterday, and these six were all in close contact with him.
They are due to go for a test, but two of them are already showing symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative result from a sample taken at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says it is likely that he was recently infected with the virus and that the virus has not yet been detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not rule out the possibility that the man may have become infected here in Iceland, but not brought the virus with him to the country.
It's not quite possible to say that this is definitely imported infection because it is so long ago that he came to the country that he might have been infected here, like these two who have caused a small outbreak in relation to the sporting events."
However, she says it is very unlikely because of how few people he has met here.
It's very unlikely," says Kamilla, but adds that it can't be ruled out until the Icelandic genetics institute has finished sequencing the virus in the man.
If we get a virus variant that has not been seen here before, then it is almost certain that it has been brought here.
Pepper spray and stun guns used against protesters
Tensions escalated between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and non-lethal grenade launchers on the protesters, but the protesters broke windows and lit fires.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Protests against police brutality and racial discrimination were widespread in the United States last night, but the Seattle protests were in support of the Portland protests in Oregon.
One of the protesters was shot dead in Austin, Texas.
The BBC reports that the attacker has been apprehended.
Thousands came together in peaceful protests in Seattle.
A group of people set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city's courthouse.
Following that, the police said the demonstrations were disorderly and there were clashes between groups of protesters and police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police in August last year, was remembered by protesters.
A car ran into a group of protesters in the city, but no one was hurt.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the National Guard came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was killed by police at her home in March.
The group carried firearms and marched in columns at a closed intersection where the police ordered the group to disperse from a group of people who were protesting the protests and carried firearms.
Seventy-five were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defines our era
Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær does not want to make too much of the importance of today's game against Leicester in the final match of the Premier League season.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea don't beat Wolves, United will end up in 5th place and miss out on a Champions League spot.
However, they still have hope of getting into the Champions League by winning the Europa League in the next month.
We are not at the end of the road.
If we get a point against Leicester, I think people will say we haven't had a bad season," said Solskjær.
Whatever happens, though, this is not the end of our journey, because we still have a lot of ground to make up to the teams above us," said Solskjær.
It is clear that men's nerves will be frayed by 1500 BST today, but Solskjær tried to act as if it was just another game.
If you want to be a part of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is what the company is based on.
We have prepared ourselves for a great opportunity to end the season on a high and now it is up to us to take it," said Solskjær.
This is not the most important game of the season, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our era, we have already had many moments that define this era."
Bruno Fernandes' arrival has changed a lot for us and I believe we are in better shape and mentally stronger than we were last season," said Solskjær.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new cases of the coronavirus were reported in the United States yesterday, according to the John Hopkins University.
A total of 4.178.021 cases have been confirmed in the western hemisphere since the start of the pandemic in that country.
900 people died of the virus yesterday, the last four days have seen more than 1,000 deaths from the virus.
So far, 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, the number of deaths from the virus is expected to reach 175,000 by August 15th.
Fear another wave of the pandemic
Spanish authorities are now struggling to contain the spread of COVID-19 within the country.
Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID-19 on both Thursday and Friday.
There have been no new cases in 24 hours since the beginning of May, and the news comes at the same time as the Spanish are lifting their strictest travel ban in Europe.
The backlog has led to British authorities requiring passengers arriving from Spain to go into quarantine upon arrival.
Just a week ago, Spain was on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is at its worst in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where authorities have imposed wide-ranging restrictions in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus.
In the city of Barcelona, bars and nightclubs will be closed for the next two weeks and nightclubs will have to close at midnight.
Now, a curfew is in effect for 200,000 residents in Seguria province in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and has been badly affected by the pandemic.
Tui, the largest tour operator in the UK, cancelled all flights scheduled for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for a second wave of the pandemic, but little appetite seems to be for reinstating the far-reaching lockdowns that have left economies in ruins.
For example, Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, has taken a very dim view of such things and compared them to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said the country "wouldn't be able to survive, economically or socially," if another nationwide lockdown were implemented.
Many officials are hoping that localized measures will be enough to stop the spread of the virus in the next round of infections.
Five new cases in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic cases were reported yesterday, in addition to two more at the border.
Five individuals tested positive for Covid-19 in Iceland yesterday.
In the alert from the Civil Protection Agency, it says that one of the cases is connected to the infection detected yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent into isolation and the sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in a sports club in Reykjavik and is, according to the announcement, "only a part of the sports team" in quarantine.
Others who were sent into quarantine are connected to the man in a different way.
The origin of this outbreak is unknown, and disease surveillance is ongoing by the Public Health Agency of Iceland.
The organizers of the ReyCUP tournament have adhered to the guidelines and recommendations of the epidemiologist and the Civil Protection Agency, which are still in force, and appropriate measures have been taken.
Even though the pictures from the tournament attracted attention as one could see the players celebrating their team's good performance outside the field, close to each other.
Just before 11 this morning, tournament organizers posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
Here, "PARENTS PLEASE NOTE: Students are asked to bring their own equipment to school."
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection detected the day before.
In the notice it says: "Icelandic genetic testing has sequenced the infections and discovered a new strain of the virus that has not been found here before."
Smitrakning is also underway in that case, and the infected person is in isolation and 12 are in quarantine due to the infection.
The third case involves a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15.
He was found on the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six people who were in close contact with him are in quarantine.
Two of them are already showing symptoms of the virus.
In addition, two people were detected at the border and are awaiting the results of further investigations, as the procedure for quarantine at the border specifies.
Finally, the notice concludes: The Icelandic Civil Protection Agency and the Office of the State Epidemiologist urge people to take care and pay attention to individual hygiene measures.
If there is any doubt as to whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to go to the nearest health clinic for a test.
Patreksfjordur says camping site booked up for Easter weekend - Turns away visitors
The campsite at Patreksfjord is fully booked over the weekend, according to an announcement from Vesturbyggð.
Guests are encouraged to consider other accommodation options.
They name Vesturbyggð, Bíldudal, Tálknafjörð, Melanes on Rauðasandi, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breiðavík as alternative options.
There's plenty going on in Patreksfjord this weekend, as Patreksfjord Film Festival, a festival of Icelandic documentaries, is being held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
Expectations are high for a good turnout this year, if the weather doesn't put a damper on things, but DV reported earlier today about a gloomy forecast.
However, the worst weather is expected in the south, and hope for Patreksfirðinga.
The bb.is website reported first, and said that all other accommodation in the town was already fully booked.
An entire apartment block is crumbling down at the best spot in the city
Romanian laborers live for free at Dunhaga 18–20.
While property owners are waiting for building permits for renovations, their applications have been stuck in the system for three years.
In one of Reykjavik's oldest, greenest and most expensive neighborhoods, a stately three-story apartment building stands.
On the ground floor of the house, there is about 600 square metres of retail space.
Behind the house, there are two staircases, each with four quite spacious apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square feet, though most are over 100.
The house has a rich history.
It was built in 1959 and has housed a video rental, Skóstofan, the Mjólkursamsölun mjólkurbúð, Jóa byssusmið, fishmonger and, most recently, the University Press.
The house has, to put it mildly, lost some of its lustre.
The house now lies in ruins, as can be seen in the accompanying photographs.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf., according to the company register, are Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús was responsible for the ownership group of Borgun and was the managing director of the ownership holding company Borgun.
In the ownership group of Borgun, Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is a company founded by Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also a co-owner of D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, ran the shipping company Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has done little or nothing since then.
Neighbours say the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily over the years, though most recently.
One resident on the neighborhood's Facebook page said the house "hasn't been particularly lively over the past few years."
It is possible that the owners have been seeking to change the house and the plot for a few years.
Neighbours say the house has been in disrepair for a long time.
It's long overdue for something to be done about this area and it's a shame it's taken so long."
He also claims that he is fed up with the owners of the house for not having completed the work, finding a common ground with the neighbours and ending this "lawsuit".
We need to do this in consultation with the community around us so that we can drive this forward and finish it.
The "legal thicket" that the resident refers to is the planning process that has been underway since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then sought permission to build an extension on top of the existing multi-family house and behind the house, a new elevator and an extension on one floor, as well as a basement.
The building permit that was granted for that project was challenged to the Environmental and Natural Resources Review Tribunal and the tribunal ruled that the project was not in accordance with the zoning plan and that the public consultation was insufficient.
Reykjavíkurborg started the planning process and completed it with an announcement in Stjórnartíðindin in July last year.
The planning was also challenged, and the committee declared it invalid in March 2020.
At this point, it was nearly three years since the original application for building permission and the owners of the house were at the starting point.
The house had fallen into disrepair by this time, and neighbours were beginning to tire of it.
When DV asked neighbors about the situation and their reactions were varied.
Some understood the owner's intentions, while others did not.
Others directed their anger at the city, while others did not.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily at anyone in particular.
Others said the parking spaces were a nuisance, but neighbours have used unused parking spaces at Dunhaga 18–20 under their cars.
One complainant in the case said he was tired of the bureaucracy:
It's absolutely incredible that we have to go through the process three times.
It's like Reykjavíkurborg doesn't know how to read."
Today, the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial to the city's civic administration and the noble intentions of the owner and their many years of work that is now at the starting point.
When a reporter arrived at Dunhaga 18, he was greeted by an open door and a pile of rubbish.
A Playstation console and a new television lay among other rubbish on the planet - victims of Icelandic summer holidays.
The old printing office of the University was opened and there were a lot of cats with the smell of urine.
It is clear that someone has taken up residence in one of the corners, but no one is visible.
Piles of couches and mattresses and a few geology magazines, which presumably were meant to be a book, lay on the floor.
The stairways of the apartment house were also open, and life in both of them.
The reporter was lucky enough to run into one of them.
The Romanians were cooking potatoes for their evening meal and invited the journalist to join them.
The Romanians work for the staffing company Ztrongforce ehf.
They've been there for some time and according to DV, the company hasn't paid for the housing at all, except for electricity and heating.
Because of the condition of the house, it is not reasonable to collect rent.
From the postboxes in the hallway of the house it is clear that there has been a number of foreign labourers living there over the past few months.
The operation of staffing agencies has not been affected by the Covid-19 situation, as the downturn in tourism has led to a downturn in the construction industry, and these two industries have been the most active to use staffing agencies.
Despite this, the Dunhaga 18 tenants seemed to have enough to do and the work clothes and socks were hanging in the common area to dry after a long rainy day.
It should be noted that, despite the deplorable state of the house, the apartment that the boys shared appeared to be well-maintained.
When the reporter bid farewell to the Rumanian boys, he became suddenly clear-sighted: A 1,500-square-metre property in downtown Reykjavik is being neglected.
The owners want to improve the property and the neighbours want better conditions but there is disagreement about what constitutes "improvement".
Meanwhile, the city's planning department sits at the start of the planning process, as the victim of endless appeals and the possibility of judicial review in the planning process.
In the house live Rumanian laborers, perhaps those who will be fixing the situation when the Icelanders stop bickering.
The article was originally published in the weekend edition of DV on July 17.
Tackling obesity in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic
Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson will give £10 million to a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on fast-food advertising, following his own health scare.
Johnson is expected to launch the campaign, which has been given the name Better Health, on Monday, with doctors being encouraged to prescribe cycling for their overweight patients, and there will also be a push to increase the number of bike lanes.
Advertisements for fast-food outlets on television will be banned after 21 at night, according to British media sources.
COVID-19 has woken us up to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined to make us healthier, more active and eat more healthily," a spokesperson said.
Johnson himself has struggled with weight issues, but he was admitted to intensive care when he became infected with the coronavirus earlier this year, and his illness is partly attributed to his weight.
Women are better suited to lead the changes
She said the new constitution was the biggest step the country could take towards greater decentralisation, transparency and in the fight against corruption and for the common good.
We need to change gears a little bit now and who is better suited to lead those changes rather than the group of society that has it easier to be in those values.
There are women," Helga said.
Icelandic women are famous for their women's quarters.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
So now it's our turn to lead these changes."
She said she was a little uneasy about the focus on Iceland as "best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
We're not as prepared to look at what needs to be done.
Like the Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
There's a lot of it.
We have to know where we're coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We don't live by the same rules here," Helga said.
When asked, she said that women were in good shape in Iceland, but added that, like in many other places, Icelandic men lived by very masculine values.
She said that politics revolved around their own interests, power and authority, which were the forces that upheld injustice in all societies.
Women have now formed this group and are coming together and are a little frustrated by the fact that the Icelandic parliament keeps ignoring this referendum from 2012," she said.
It's these feminine values that we're thinking about it from.
On the basis of human rights and environmental protection, cooperation and the fact that we all sit at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned principles are the founding principles of the new constitution.
We are a very rich country in terms of natural resources and it is ridiculous that people here live in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can do it differently," Helga said.
It's ridiculous that there's a natural law that women's jobs are always paid less.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to keep fighting for decent wages just to get a living wage."
You can sign the petition for a new constitution here through electronic Iceland.
Tried to rob a pedestrian in downtown
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to steal money from them.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbæ, where two were arrested.
Police then stopped a motorcyclist in Hlíðar, where the rider was travelling at 146 km/h on a road with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been stripped of his right to drive.
The police in the capital area had a lot to do in the night and there were more than 80 cases recorded in the police log from five o'clock in the morning to five o'clock in the morning.
Then, there was a lot of noise alerts because of the celebrations.
Eleven noisy gatherings were reported overnight Friday, and it seemed like a lot in the police log.
Last night, however, 22 incidents were reported to the police.
Six were placed in solitary confinement overnight.
Police were called to the Árbæ in the night when individuals shot fireworks into the air.
They were already out of the way when the police officers arrived.
Nine motorists were stopped for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Four were arrested for fighting in the city center in the night, and one of them was detained in a detention cell.
Two were taken to the emergency department after they fell on their faces, one in the city centre and the other in Vesturbær.
One was transported to the emergency department after he was injured while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a cyclist who dragged a trailer on Kjalarnes yesterday.
The bicycle was in "very poor condition," according to police notes, and was impounded.
Accommodation in Monet's house during the salesman's holiday
The house, which the impressionist Claude Monet lived in for the last forty years of his life, is now available to rent via Airbnb.
The next vacant nights in the house are around the shopping holiday.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy in France.
The famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two sitting rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet got his first inspiration to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone wants to rent the house, they will have to rent it for at least two nights.
According to Airbnb, it's the second most available after Sunday of the Labor Day weekend, so it might be a good fit for some laborers on vacation to book a house of the painter.
The two nights over the shopping holiday cost only 964 US dollars or just over 130,000 Icelandic crowns, according to Fréttablaðið.
Dozens in self-isolation and some of them showing symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Iceland over the past three days, and most of those infected are not connected to each other.
Several are in quarantine due to this, and some of them are showing symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three domestic cases of the coronavirus were reported yesterday and two at the border checkpoint.
A specialist at the office of the State Epidemiologist says that the increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading further out into society.
The second domestic infection has been sequenced, and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has gone undetected in the community at some point.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very vigilant now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, a specialist in infectious diseases at the office of the State Epidemiologist.
Most of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from overseas.
Further testing will take place in the coming days, and some of those who were in contact with those infected are showing symptoms of the coronavirus.
At the moment there is no flu epidemic and fewer cases of other respiratory infections, so we can be relatively relaxed about doing these tests on individuals who would have been tested during the influenza epidemic, said Kamilla.
The tracing of contacts is largely complete, but it is not ruled out that more people will have to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected were infected after attending a sporting event.
Has this raised questions about whether it is appropriate to hold such an event.
The agency's emergency management director says it's possible as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
Kamilla says it is practically impossible that the infected have become infected at the sporting event.
If more people don't go into isolation after coming into contact with these individuals at these sporting events, then we can say that our infection prevention measures at the events have worked.
But we don't know yet," Kamilla said.
The procedures of the Civil Protection Department are being reviewed continuously.
We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if the situation warrants it," Kamilla said.
After about a week, it is expected that the capacity limits will be relaxed up to a thousand people.
This new location may have an impact on the easing of restrictions.
A "certain meditation to cook" - See Elísa Víðar's menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an athlete in football and plays for Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a nutritionist.
She needs a lot of energy to get through the day and often takes the time to cook a good and nutritious meal.
A typical day for me starts by going to work at eight in the morning," says Elísa.
After work, I go to the supermarket to be able to prepare the evening meal before I pick up my daughter from kindergarten at three o'clock.
Elísu finds it very nurturing to pick up her daughter early for preschool.
It's good to have time with her before I go to training in the afternoon.
After a workout, it's good to come home and only have to reheat the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to empty our minds."
Elísa does not follow any particular diet.
She is putting the finishing touches on her master's thesis in nutrition and knows exactly what she needs to eat to have enough energy to work, school, family and training.
What works for me is eating a variety of food that is well balanced with proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not to categorize food as good or bad, rather nutritious or non-nutritious.
It's all right to eat everything, just not all at once and not always."
Elísa has a great interest in cooking.
I find a certain meditation in standing in the kitchen and cooking, and I seek that out very much.
I have to say that self-confidence is with me in the kitchen and I really believe that I am a decent cook."
Morning meal: oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, left to soak overnight in almond milk.
Finish this meal with whatever is available at the time.
Usually it's banana and sticky muesli & coffee.
I'm a big coffee drinker.
Minimal: Extremely variable, but fruit or vegetables, bagels, plain yogurt with banana and muesli, bread with toppings and I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if that's what was available.
Lunch: I often make all sorts of salad from what is in the fridge, quinoa or bulgur, falafel balls, rock salad, baked vegetables with a good dressing is what I am working on.
If the planning goes awry (which happens often), the egg-vending machine at work has come to my rescue more than once, and then it's two slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, and I won't put any more pressure on you.
Millimál: Get something with carbohydrates for exercise, bread with toppings, muesli or fruit.
Dinner: Fish will often be the choice at my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Tensions between police and protesters in Seattle
City officials in Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of emergency following widespread protests in the city center.
Yesterday, police used tear gas and pepper spray to try to clear a large area where protesters had laid down.
The police announced on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into the damage done to the police station in the city yesterday, possibly by a bomb.
City and police officials say protesters threw rocks, bottles, Molotov cocktails and other objects at police, and one police officer was taken to a hospital with injuries.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
They were blowing their whistles to show solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there has been repeated clashes between protesters and heavily armed law enforcement officers.
There, like in other cities in the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, mourn the death of George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, and protest against systemic racism in the American society.
Not withdrawn until after a vote
It is not yet known whether the dismissal of the Icelandair flight attendants, which are to take effect next month, will be rescinded.
Electronic voting on a collective agreement between the Icelandair pilots' union and Icelandair will end at midday tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, chairwoman of the union, is certain that Icelandair will not make a decision about the layoffs before the outcome of the vote is known.
This definitely hangs together," says Guðlaug Líney.
None of the redundancies have been rescinded, this has to be rectified so that the planes can be manned.
Of course, people are obviously eager to find out whether they will have a job after the end of the month."
Voters will be asked to approve a deal that was signed last week, just before midnight on July 19.
It is expected to run until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that flight attendants had previously rejected in a ballot.
On the 17th of July, the union and the works council of the Flight Attendants Union of Iceland approved a strike against Icelandair, approved by the union members in a vote.
It never happened, but this was decided in the wake of Icelandair's decision to end negotiations with the Flight Attendants' Union, dismiss all its flight attendants, and seek a collective agreement with another union.
The airline's pilots were then tasked with taking on temporary safety-related duties on board.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it's difficult to say.
People are still reeling from Icelandair's hostile takeover, when all its cabin crew were sacked and told they would be replaced by another union.
Now we'll see whether it has an effect," she says.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelandair in late April, when 900 of them, or 95%, were laid off.
Their notice period varies, with the shortest being three months and ending in July or August.
Ninety percent of Icelandair's flight attendants are in that group.
What happens if the agreement is not approved?
We look forward to continuing discussions with our counterparts.
With this agreement, we are meeting the demands of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that flight attendants feel that they have gone too far."
Voting on the collective agreement concludes and Icelandair will announce the results of the second quarter of the year tomorrow.
Vote on a new collective agreement for flight attendants will end at midday on Tuesday.
Icelandair's second quarter results will also be released tomorrow, with preliminary results indicating that the company's revenues have fallen by 85 percent compared to the same period last year.
Electronic voting on the collective agreement between the Icelandic Pilots Association and the Icelandic Business Association for Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22, and will end on Monday, July 27, at midday.
Those who are allowed to vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the Icelandic Pilots' Association.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective agreement overnight Sunday, July 19. The day before, Icelandair had broken off negotiations with the union after flight attendants had voted to reject the previous agreement in early July.
Icelandair had fired all its flight attendants and pilots on Friday, but the dismissals were rescinded after a new collective bargaining agreement was signed.
According to the new collective agreement, flight attendants will have to work five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The collective bargaining agreement is valid until 2025, and it includes provisions for flight attendants and pilots about how long they can work on a single shift.
The agreement was presented to FFÍ members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday, and many flight attendants who spoke to the news agency at the time expressed their dissatisfaction with the agreement.
Most seemed to agree that the agreement had to be accepted in order to keep the union alive.
Icelandair's second quarter earnings will be announced tomorrow, with the company's EBIT, operating profit excluding interest and taxes, is expected to be negative by 100 to 110 million US dollars or 15 billion Icelandic crowns.
Icelandair sent the stock exchange a provisional balance sheet last Wednesday, stating that the company's revenue amounted to 60 million dollars during the quarter or 8.3 billion Icelandic crowns.
Handy cash and its equivalent had been around $154 million at the end of the quarter, around $21 billion.
Icelandair is also aiming to offer shares in the company in August.
Icelandair is aiming to complete negotiations with 15 lenders, the government and Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month, before going ahead with a share issue.
A new subvariant rather than a new strain of the virus
A new variant means that this has been an individual who has come from elsewhere.
This is not something that has been brewing domestically," says Már Kristjánsson, a specialist in infectious diseases at Landspítalan, about the news that "a new type of virus" has been found here in Iceland.
Three domestic cases were reported yesterday and two at the border.
One person who tested positive had been involved in a football club's social activities at the Rey Cup tournament, and the source of the infection is unknown and the tracing of infections is ongoing.
Also, a person who came to the country on July 15 was found to be infected, and two people who were in contact with him have begun to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday's outbreak was linked to the outbreak from the day before, and after genetic sequencing by the Icelandic Genetic Agency, a "new strain of the virus" was discovered.
The tracing of contacts is complete in relation to this infection.
Már stresses that this is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread all over the world, i.e. the new corona virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to refer to a new variant of that virus rather than a new species of the virus.
Asked what it might mean and whether it might say something about a second wave of the epidemic, Már said that, as it stands now, it is just a single case and it might not turn out to be anything more than that.
On the other hand, however, if there are cases within the country that are not related to foreign genetic material and have the same genetic makeup as this particular variant, it would be possible to draw that conclusion [of a second wave], but it is premature to do so at this point," Már explains.
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to Iceland's happiness hidden in the hot pots?
BBC daytime schedulers lead the way in an entertaining video that sheds light on the nation's sauna and hot tub culture.
Iceland's bathing culture is unique in the world and it is claimed that nowhere else in the world has as many bathing places per inhabitant.
The natural geothermal is the basis for it, as well as the tradition of swimming here.
Bathing children was mandated by law in 1940, but older citizens are just as likely to take advantage of the hot springs for their health.
Sundays are described as a fixed part of general welfare of the country.
Everyone in the pot is equal, regardless of class and position.
People talk about personal matters or enjoy the healing power of water: meditating and recharging batteries for the soul and body.
Seeking 100 days in the run-up to elections
One hundred days remain until Americans go to the polls and choose their president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he is facing an uphill battle.
Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has a significant advantage over Trump on a national scale, according to polls.
According to a new poll from the Associated Press, a majority of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the new coronavirus pandemic is also very unpopular and, in addition, more Americans now believe the president has botched the economy.
Specifically, only two in ten Americans say the U.S. is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the pandemic and 48 percent say he has handled the economy well.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to FiveThirtyEight, Biden's national average is 49.9 percent while Trump's is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to divert attention away from his handling of the pandemic to Biden, stirring up culture wars and promoting policies that are supposed to focus on law and regulation.
But Biden's campaign is putting a lot of effort into keeping the focus on Trump and believes there are good chances of winning if the election turns out to be a referendum on how Trump has performed over the past four years.
Trump's unpopularity also seems to be taking a toll on Republicans in Congress, and there is concern that Democrats could even pick up a majority in the Senate, which has been held by the GOP until now.
Politico reported earlier this month that the party's share of the electorate and its presidential nominee would be roughly equivalent, and that the Republican Party would suffer its worst electoral drubbing in decades.
The suburbs have proved particularly bad news for the party in the parliamentary elections of 2016, and it now looks as if that trend will continue.
Trump has been trying to scare residents of outlying areas into supporting him, including by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy outlying areas of the U.S. and stir up racial tensions.
Among other things, Trump has rolled back a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in outer suburbs.
He then urged "housewives" of rural America to read a former deputy governor of New York's op-ed, in which she claimed Biden would destroy rural America and took Trump under that umbrella.
Biden will demolish your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it better," the president said.
Residents of the exurbs of the United States are a growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they represent about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received a majority of the vote from this group has become president.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney received a majority of the vote from this group and lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that, despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the outer suburbs in 2016, his popularity has plummeted.
While the polls vary, Biden has a fifteen-point lead over Trump in the polls in recent polls.
Regis Philbin is dead
The American television host Regis Philbin has died at the age of 88.

Will the Olympic torch be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision was taken to postpone the Olympic Games, an event only interrupted by world wars, the president of the International Olympic Committee said the Olympic flame would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," referring to the worldwide coronavirus pandemic.
Elite athletes have an extra year to prepare, and Japan's authorities are footing the extra cost of the postponement.
However, everyone is holding their breath, as much is at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese representatives were jubilant.
They wept and laughed back and forth, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Games but lost out to Rio in Brazil.
Tokyo and Japan were in the spotlight this time.
The games were scheduled to take place from July 24 to August 9, but have been postponed by a year and will start on July 23, 2021, and end on August 8.
If the Games cannot go ahead, if the coronavirus threat remains too great, the Games will be cancelled.
Nobody wants to think that thought through to the end.
The Olympic Games are no ordinary athletic competition.
There's nothing to save, the show must always be spectacular and strive to top the last games.
The selection of the host city for the Olympic Games is based on the assessment of the selection committee on the presentations of the cities.
The more spectacular the presentation - the greater the likelihood of winning the prize.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to keep the 2016 Games or about $20 billion.
In the second time, when the application for the 2020 games was made, 75 million dollars, about ten billion krónur, were put into the promotion.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the games this year, Japanese authorities had already allocated 30 billion yen to the project.
However, that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build an Olympic village, stadiums, and generally strengthen the infrastructure of the country to be able to host such an event, prepare for it, and hold the games.
Organisers in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which had been scheduled to take place this month but has been postponed due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, in a report from Japan's auditor general, which came out at the end of last year, it was revealed that the cost was actually twice that figure.
It is unlikely that it will be possible to fully assess the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars on top of the initial cost.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could run as high as $15 to $30 billion.
The numbers are so high that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic government would not be enough to finance just over half of the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of economic analysis, with economists trying to assess the benefits and costs of the Games.
It seems that quite a few people have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympic Games are not as positive for the economies of the cities that host them.
There are some short-term effects, for example, a lot of jobs are created very quickly, but in the long run cities often remain with a debt hangover and high operating costs for unused buildings.
Rio in Brazil has significant debts from the 2016 games and has struggled to maintain all of the large athletic facilities that were built for the games.
Numbers have been analysed after the London 2012 games and it has come to light that only 10 per cent of those who got a job related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
This means that there was not a lot of new jobs created.
In general, cities have not come out well financially from hosting the Olympics due to the costly infrastructure required to host the games.
However, the benefits are often considered to lie in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic host cities after the games, though there is great uncertainty about the games in 2021.
It is also unclear whether it will be possible to accommodate all the number of spectators who normally attend the games.
The most important thing, however, is the honour of being chosen, which is difficult to quantify in monetary terms.
Despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the athletes bring is not of such a nature that it is possible to put a monetary value on it.
While the exhibition is often grandiose and nothing is spared, this is not just about money.
It's the athletes who are in the limelight.
For some elite athletes, postponing the games is just what the doctor ordered.
Australian pentathlete and gold medalist in her event at the 2016 Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is pregnant and would have been far from good shape this summer, but hopes to be in shape for the 2021 games.
She's one of the athletes who are just generally happy about the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who intended to retire after the Games this year, they would have been held at the right time, which means that postponing the Games in some cases means that they will retire before the Games even start.
They just can't trust their bodies to go through the grueling workouts.
Very few athletes have come so far into the hearts of spectators at the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold medals around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has appeared in several interviews in her home country of the United States in recent weeks to discuss the Olympics.
She's aiming for the 2021 Games, but she's not certain she'll be at the top of her game by then. She'll be 24 by then.
Although it is not generally considered to be a high age, it is in the upper echelon for a gymnast at the top of her game.
This is a sensitive topic," Biles said with a smile in an interview with the Olympic governing body posted on Instagram. Asked if she was aiming to match her performance at the 2021 games, she said she wasn't sure.
I just don't know if I'm going to be on top of my game after a year of extra training," Biles said.
She has previously talked about her body not being able to handle the stress of gymnastics for a long time.
Nevertheless, she is training hard for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles acknowledged the uncomfortable feeling of having to suddenly stop training when the pandemic was at its worst and the gymnastics gym was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles rather than any other athlete while all athletic facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold medals could not buy her access beyond the others, she had to find other ways to keep herself in shape.
The basic form is certainly better than most people's.
We have a tough plan now.
It was difficult to start training again after the gymnastics hall reopened.
We started off slowly but we are now in full swing and I will increase my training as the year progresses.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we are practicing based on the assumption that they will be, and we can't do anything else.
I'm done putting so much pressure on myself to leave the sport," Biles says.
With her, as with many others, there is a sense of doom or perhaps more a sense of awareness of the possibility that the games will not be held in 2021.
That's a hopeless task.
No one knows how the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021, and there is nothing else to do but to prepare for the Olympic Games, based on the fact that they will be held.
Perhaps the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Postponed wedding due to pandemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
I think there are more important things to think about right now," the actress said in an interview with People.
We would like to get married at some point and have that dream wedding and have all the people who are dear to us there.
But we decided to postpone it and focus on what's important right now, which is to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I'm more interested in world news than wedding news these days.
There's a lot going on and we need to pay attention to what's happening in the world."
